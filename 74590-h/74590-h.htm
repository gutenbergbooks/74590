<i>Buffalo, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, Wednesday, June 21, 1916</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>The commission met at Buffalo, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, Wednesday, June 21, 1916,
at 10 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Gentlemen, you will kindly come to order. Perhaps
it would not be amiss to say a word concerning the purpose of
the International Joint Commission in meeting here at this time.</p>

<p>As you know, the United States and Great Britain entered into a
treaty that was proclaimed in May, 1910, in which, among other
things, they agreed that the boundary waters and waters flowing
across the boundary should not be polluted to the injury of the
health or property of the people on the other side. With the promulgation
of that treaty the International Joint Commission came
into existence. Its functions are dual; it has both judicial and investigative
duties. In respect to this particular case the duties of
the commission are purely investigative.</p>

<p>The question was referred to this commission to determine whether
or not the boundary waters were being polluted in contravention of
the treaty. The commission issued a progress report early in 1914,
which set forth very clearly what had been ascertained, what had
been demonstrated, up to that time. Subsequent to that, in following
out the line of the second question of reference, the commission
employed <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Earle B. Phelps, of the United States Public Health
Service, to devise plans that might be applicable, especially to Buffalo
and Detroit. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps has completed that work and his
report has been submitted to you for your investigation.</p>

<p>The International Joint Commission has thought it wise to come
here to Buffalo and hold these conferences with you for the purpose
of determining whether or not we are in full accord with respect
to the report made by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps, and, if not, in what way
we differ and whether or not it will be possible to reconcile our differences,
because the commission is anxious to work in harmony with
you, as I apprehend you are with the commission.</p>


<p class="center">
NOTIFICATIONS OF THE SESSION.<br>

<p class="p2"><a id="CLINTON"></a>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Mr. Clinton, do you appear in behalf of anyone
other than yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. Mr. Chairman, I represent the Erie &amp; Ontario
Canal <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, which has a plan that will take care of all this sewage.
That plan has been presented to this commission three times, and I,
therefore, did not propose at this time to speak upon the subject.
You have among your records a full exposition of the plan and
what it is expected to do. I am here this morning rather as a
listener. I expect subsequently to present our views to the council
of the city of Buffalo, they having had no opportunity to investigate
the questions. I have read your report, and I must say that it exhibits
not only thorough research but also <span class="lock">some——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Clinton, will you allow me to interrupt you in
order to ask a question? You have read the report of the consulting
sanitary engineer of the commission, have you not? I refer to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
part of it at least which deals with the project in which you are
interested as a means of sewage disposal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. Yes. In the press of business I have read it rather
hastily and without making it a study.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I wanted to ask if you took issue with the report of
the consulting engineer with respect to the conclusions which he has
reached regarding the drainage or diversion canal. Do you appear
for the purpose of making any criticism of those conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. No; not at this juncture. If the commission will
permit me, I may subsequently submit a printed brief without taking
the time here by either criticizing or attempting to modify in
the minds of the commission the views of the experts. I think it
would be a loss of time now and result in no good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Mr. Kreinheder, I believe you were about to make a
statement and were interrupted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kreinheder</span>. I was merely going to say that the city of Buffalo
extends its greetings to this commission. Since your last meeting in
this city Buffalo has taken on an entirely new cloak in that it is now
governed under a new form of government, the commission form of
government. All the powers for conducting the city’s business are
vested in five men. The propositions that this council has to deal
with are many. One of them is the pollution of boundary waters,
the subject that you gentlemen have under consideration at this
time. The new administration since the issue of your report has not
had time to go into it thoroughly in order to determine which of
the six plans that you suggest is feasible. It may be that your
commission can suggest which one of those plans is feasible. However,
if that is left to the different cities it will be necessary, in order
to satisfy our municipality and the taxpayers, to employ an engineer
to go over your suggestion with respect to these different plans and
determine which of them is the most feasible. After that determination
is made there comes a question of providing the money, and that
may possibly take considerable time, because without money these big
projects can not be carried out.</p>

<p>Now, that in toto is our proposition to-day. The council is represented
here and is very glad to extend to the commission every
courtesy and at the same time do all we possibly can in order to
bring out the points involved and see whether we can carry this
matter to a proper solution. That is the attitude of the city of Buffalo,
and we would like you gentlemen to so understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. May I be permitted to ask a question? The jurisdiction
of this commission depends entirely upon the determination
of the question as to whether the pollution of boundary waters affects
the waters on both sides of the boundary lines. If it does not,
the commission of course has no jurisdiction, and it is not an international
question. But I understand that the commission has heretofore
determined that in the case of the Niagara River the discharge
of sewage by the city of Buffalo does affect the international waters,
and that therefore the question involved in this vicinity is an international
question. Since the final determination of the location of
the boundary line I think the prior attitude—if I may call it an
attitude—assumed by the commission in that regard is strongly fortified;
but I do not understand whether the commission has yet decided
that the present and inevitable growth of the discharge of sewage into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the Niagara River so affects the health, the welfare, and I may say,
to a certain extent, the business of both communities—that is, the
community on either side of the line—as to make it necessary that
no sewage from the city of Buffalo—and I may add Lackawanna—shall
be discharged into the Niagara River through the lake. I do
not recall in the reports any such decision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is it not a fact that the bacteriological examination
of the Niagara River shows conclusively that the waters are being
polluted clear across the stream to an extent that is injurious to
health and property on the other side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. I drew that conclusion from one of the reports made
by the commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is included in the progress report, the report
of the bacteriologists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. Yes; but I am not aware that the commission has
decided that the extent of that is such that the discharge of sewage
must be stopped.</p>

<p>Now, I regard that as of considerable importance not merely to my
people but to the city of Buffalo, and I wish to say to this commission
that I am more deeply interested on the part of the city of Buffalo
than I am on the part of our proposed corporation. The expense
to the city of Buffalo in caring for that sewage, if it must be
taken out of the Niagara River altogether, will be tremendous. That
is the reason I asked the question.</p>

<p>Your honorable commission will say to our people eventually that
this sewage must be taken out. I think some limit has been placed
upon it, but I regard that as merely tentative; it must be taken out
eventually. Then it becomes a mere question for the city authorities
to determine upon the methods of caring for the sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Clinton, speaking for myself as a member of
the commission, I would say that the report of our sanitary experts
submitted to the commission in January, 1914, shows quite conclusively
that the waters of the Niagara River, together with the
waters of other connecting rivers, are being polluted in violation of
the treaty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. Yes; there is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It is not the function of the commission in this investigation
to decide anything finally or to decide in advance whether
or not we should recommend to the two Governments that the cities
be called upon to do thus and so, but in the event that these waters
are found to be polluted in violation of the treaty we are required
by the two Governments to recommend to them what remedies we
propose for this pollution, which is being allowed to go on in contravention
of the treaty.</p>

<p>For the purpose of ascertaining the most feasible remedy the commission
has employed consulting sanitary engineers, who have been
engaged now for more than a year on investigations at Buffalo, Detroit,
and other places. They have embodied in their report to the
commission certain suggestions and recommendations with respect
to remedies.</p>

<p>This report was sent out six weeks before this meeting to the
various municipalities in order that they might familiarize themselves
with the proposed remedies for the pollution which has been
found to exist in violation of the treaty, and our purpose in being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
here is to confer with the representatives of the various municipalities
that are affected to ascertain what their judgment is as to the
remedies which have been proposed by our consulting engineers.
This information is desired by the commission before we submit to
the two Governments a final report embodying our recommendations.
We desire to see what suggestions or criticisms these municipalities
have to make, because there is no denying the fact that pollution
does exist in contravention of the treaty. That fact has been established
by bacteriological examination. Nor is there any question
that it must stop from an international standpoint. That is, both
Governments, having solemnly agreed by treaty that such pollution
should not be permitted to the injury of the health or property of
the people of either country, that treaty obligation will have to be
observed. Of course, it is the hope of the commission that these
municipalities will cooperate as far as possible in agreeing upon
some recommended remedy that will be practicable and feasible so
that the two Governments may reach an agreement as to what should
be done hereafter. As stated by the chairman, that is the purpose
of our being here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. I understand the purpose of the commission in being
here, and the purpose as stated by you is the position which the
commission has taken from the beginning. I must beg the pardon
of the commission in using the inaccurate word “decided.” I should
have said “concluded.”</p>

<p>The problems, it seems to me, are of such a nature—I do not know
that I ought to say this, as it seems to be offering advice to the commission—that
after the city authorities have had ample opportunity
to investigate the matter for themselves you would be able to arrive
at results, and it would be more satisfactory to yourselves and to the
city than to attempt to do it at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. As I understand it, our consulting sanitary engineers
have been working here with the officials of Buffalo for over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. They were even advised when the report was submitted
to the commission what the report would be, and we supposed
by giving them six weeks’ time in which to study the specific recommendations
made by the consulting engineers that the municipal
authorities here would be able to give the commission some information
as to whether or not the proposed remedies reasonably meet with
their approval.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. Although I ought not to speak for the city government,
as I am on my feet, will you permit me to say that a suggestion
has been made and I will be presumptuous enough to answer it.
It is suggested by our commissioner of public works and also a member
of the city government that the recent change in our form of
government has thrown upon the members of the council such a tremendous
burden of work that it is impossible for them to determine
from all points of view, financial and otherwise, in such a short time
as six weeks what they will be willing to recommend to the citizens.
The time has been too short, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I do not think the commission contemplates asking
any of the municipalities to join with it in recommending any specific
remedies, but we want to hear what the municipalities have to say
with respect to the practicability or advisability of the remedies that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
are proposed. Of course the question of finance is one that will have
to be taken up later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. It is a very serious question in this city and is directly
involved in determining what they will recommend. While
fully agreeing with the report of your experts, they might think that
something less costly, something that would extend the burden over
a greater period of time, would answer all the purposes and be of a
nature that would satisfy your experts and accomplish the same
results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Well, the commission has had this under consideration
for nearly three years, as you will recall, Mr. Clinton; and the
municipalities, especially Buffalo and Detroit, must have been studying
the subject from the international standpoint, fully realizing,
no doubt, that the time has come when they must cease using these
rivers as open sewers and make some other provision for sewage
disposal. It is not the desire of the commission to make arbitrary
recommendations to the two Governments without conferring with
the municipalities in order to get their views and to recommend that
which is feasible and also desirable within their financial ability to
comply with. That is one reason why we are trying in every way
to cooperate with the municipalities that are interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. No doubt that is a very gracious and wise decision
on the part of the commission. I was simply trying to point out
that it would be impossible, it seems to me, for the city government
at this time to undertake to give views upon this subject. Councilman
Hill is present and can speak upon that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Why do you not let the city government speak for
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>. I have been drawn into this argument.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Malone</span>. As this is the last analysis of the financial proposition,
I think Commissioner Hill, of the department of finance and
account, as representing the city government, might throw some light
on the matter from a financial standpoint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. With regard to that I would suggest that the commission,
having held these hearings for several years, has probably found
the simple and expeditious way of moving along. I would suggest
that <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps be called on for a statement. He would enlighten
us as to his ideas regarding what ought to be done and the different
methods proposed. Of course, the financial proposition come in eventually.
When we have heard what methods the commission has to
present we will be in a better shape to take the matter up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Malone</span>. It was that thought that prompted me to suggest to
our distinguished friend, Mr. Clinton, that “John speak for himself.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think the only difference is that it would be better for
us to speak later. I think we would save time in that way.</p>

<p><a id="PERKINS"></a>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Mr. Chairman, would you hear a brief statement on
the general subject? The question before the commission, I believe,
relates to the effect on the people in the various cities of the pollution
of the waters of the Niagara River that are used for domestic and
sanitary purposes. Is it not true that, if there is not involved the
water that is to be used for drinking purposes in the various cities,
then very largely the pollution of the Niagara River is a matter that
is not of such great importance? For instance, the city of Buffalo
has pumping stations that will take care of the whole Niagara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
frontier. If arrangements can be made through legislation whereby
the cities of Niagara Falls, the Tonawandas, and Lockport can be
supplied with pure water from these tremendous pumping stations,
and the cost of water to them, as well as to the city of Buffalo, can
be very largely reduced by taking care of the enormous overhead
charges, it will very largely do away with the expenditure of
$3,600,000 by Buffalo and smaller amounts by the other cities that
are discharging sewage into the Niagara River.</p>

<p>The health of the people is affected only by the drinking of the
water of the Niagara River, and the solution can be obtained at very
much less expense to the city of Buffalo and the other cities involved.</p>

<p>The smell that arises at Niagara Falls, and regarding which complaint
has been made, is not due to the pollution of Niagara River
by Buffalo sewage, because oxidation of that sewage occurs and the
tremendous current takes away any stench before it reaches Niagara
Falls. The difficulty at Niagara Falls is due to the dumping of
the sewage into the Niagara River and there being thrown back
upon the people of Niagara Falls their own sewage; it is not due
to the sewage of Buffalo or any other city on the Niagara River.
The city of Chicago built a drainage canal, which, as you say, is an
open sewer. It went to the expense of $100,000,000 to build that
drainage canal, because formerly it was discharging its sewage into
its own lake, the source of its water supply. It had no natural drainage
canal such as Buffalo has through the Niagara River to carry
off that sewage in a sanitary manner.</p>

<p>Congressman Mann, within the last few day, in discussing in Congress
the La Follette amendment requiring Chicago not to take more
than 250,000 cubic feet per minute from the lake through this drainage
canal, when they are now taking practically double that amount,
pointed out that any other way of correcting the sewage proposition
for Chicago would have cost that city $250,000,000 instead of the
$100,000,000 that it did cost, and yet that canal is a very slow-moving
stream, carrying only 4,167 cubic feet per second, as required under
the treaty. That is equivalent to only one-sixtieth of the amount
of water that is passing through the Niagara River. If there were
a drainage canal built from the city of Buffalo to Lake Ontario, it
would carry only about 6,000 cubic feet per second under the treaty,
and that is one-fortieth of the amount going through Niagara River
at a tremendous rate of speed. The necessity for this tremendous
expenditure is, I think, overestimated. I think when the drinking
water of all those cities is provided for the expense will be absolutely
nil. The water, as it absorbs the sewage in the drainage canal at
Chicago, has its purification entirely through the free oxygen that
is in the drainage canal as it passes along. Here in the Niagara
River we have 60 times as much water to absorb the sewage, and it
has more than 100 times the value on account of the tremendous current
that forces the sewage up to the surface and utilizes the oxygen
in the air to purify it long before it reaches those cities.</p>

<p>I would like to ask whether the question of the pollution of the
Niagara River as it is considered by you is not entirely from the
standpoint of the health of the people on both sides of the line, not
only as to the odors that come from it, but also as a drinking proposition;
that is, whether those are the only two problems that are
being considered?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You have probably forgotten one thing which is
very important, and that is that this is an international question.
Even if you could supply water to these municipalities on your own
side, that would not prevent the Niagara River being polluted to
the danger of people living on the other side of the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. On account of the tremendous current in the Niagara
River, with the sewage from this side passing down, the cities
of Bridgeburg and Fort Erie are free to take their water for drinking
purposes on their side of the river, so that the international
feature, I think, is largely eliminated, and the only other city is
Niagara Falls, Ontario. There a great power canal is about to be
installed, developing 3,000 horsepower and taking pure water from
Lake Erie through the Welland Canal. There is a vast supply of
which only a mere fraction is necessary for the city of Niagara
Falls on the Canadian side. So you have eliminated all the troubles,
so far as drinking water is concerned, of all those cities, and the
question of drinking water, I think, is of vital importance. But we
are going to spend $3,600,000 on the sewage proposition when a
mere fraction of that amount will take care of the subsewage which
without the slightest doubt needs renovating, especially in view of
the fact that no solution in the way of chemical treatment could
possibly make that water available to those people for drinking purposes
along the lower Niagara. The chemists have confidence in
both the sludge proposition and the other treatments. For instance,
at Milwaukee they will even take a glass of the effluent and drink it,
but it does not follow that the people of Tonawanda and Lockport
should want that kind of drinking water when we can give them
pure water from Lake Erie cheaper, on account of the tremendous
pumpage facilities we have here, than they can pump it for themselves.</p>

<p>We need a filtration plant, and by spending $1,500,000 of that
money for that purpose we could have a plant that would supply
all those cities with the purest water 365 days in the year. It is
true that during the stormy seasons we have periods when the water
is in a very bad condition. The danger from typhoid, however, can
be taken care of by treating the water with chlorine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. The difficulty is that there is no question referred
to this International Joint Commission by the two Governments as
to whether or not the people in any particular locality are getting
pure water for drinking or domestic purposes. The question submitted
to us to determine is whether the international waters are
being polluted to the injury of health or property on either side of
the line. The people here are interested in the question of pure
water, and that applies all the way to Niagara Falls, but the people
on the other side of the line would not be concerned at all about
that. So that the question for the commission to determine is not
whether or not it is possible for Buffalo and these contiguous towns
to get pure water; but the question for us to determine is whether
or not these waters are being polluted, in contravention of the treaty;
and if so, what remedy we propose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. But the reason for the consideration of the pollution
is the health of the people on both sides of the river. If the
health of the people on both sides of the river can be taken care of,
and it is only for drinking purposes, and you are producing an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
effluent of 200,000,000 gallons that has been treated and used for
drinking purposes by either side, it is dangerous, ultimately, because
with the growth of this city to a million people, we will include the
whole Niagara frontier as one city. It means taking care of the
Canadian side, too, but what cities are there on the other side that
are being injured?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I am not familiar enough with it to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. There is not a town outside of Bridgeburg that is
utilizing water from the Niagara River. There is only Fort Erie
and Bridgeburg, and they have the purest water to take it from.
They have the Niagara River, which runs at the rate of 6 or 7 miles
an hour. They can get the purest water—and the finest of fish live
there—if they take it from the upper intake. I believe the whole
question is one that is very easily solved by economical means for
the benefit of the people on both sides, at one-hundredth of the expense
of the tremendous sewage disposal plant, which in itself will be
unsatisfactory. You can not take the sludge and compress it within
the city limits and dry it and sell it as fertilizer and not produce a
worse sanitary condition than you have now. Then, the drainage
canal from here across to Lake Ontario would be a slow-moving
stream, as proposed by the Lake Ontario power canal sanitary proposition.
That would cost $25,000,000, and would not be a solution of
the difficulty, because it would be an open sewer, and would be in a
worse condition than at present, because it would be a sluggish stream.
There is no question but that this matter should be considered carefully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I agree with you fully in that last statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you say there is no pollution of these waters on
the Canadian side by reason of dumping of raw sewage on this side
of the Niagara River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I say there is no place where they are using it for
drinking purposes, and there is 60 times as much water passing
through the Niagara River as at the Chicago Drainage Canal. That
would not in any way interfere with the health of the people on the
Canadian side; so that I do not think the Canadian side is interested
as much as the American side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The hearing at Niagara Falls a year ago last September
showed conclusively that the waters on that side are polluted
from the intake or from sewage dumped into the river from this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Some of it gets across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are they using that water for drinking purposes
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I am referring to Niagara Falls intake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I think the sewage at Niagara Falls can be taken
care of by taking the drinking water from Lake Erie through the
Welland power canal they are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We have not power to compel the people over there
to accept water from this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I was referring to the power canal proposed to be
constructed by the Ontario government. There will be pure water
to supply Niagara Falls, Ontario, and they will have better water
than any water that has been treated after the sewage of Buffalo has
been treated and these cities have gone into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. We have been producing water from the lower
Niagara River, at lower Niagara, for some 15,000 troops and a population
of 5,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. In reference to the aeration of the water, the Niagara
Falls is the finest sanitation plant that could possibly be built—far
better than any sanitation plant that could be built—for chemical
treatment or otherwise, because the air is thoroughly distributed all
through the water that comes down. The water becomes atomized,
and the aeration of that water absolutely purifies it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. In the lower Niagara?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. As it goes over the Falls. Every bit of water that
goes over the Falls is aerated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The experts show it is polluted from shore to shore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Do you mean that by sedimentation the heavy parts
go to the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I mean the parts of sewage are so thoroughly diffused
into the water and oxidized on the way down Niagara River
that after going over the Falls it is practically sterilized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. By what special creation have we some 30,000 or more
bacilli or bacteria to the cubic centimeter on the Niagara River below
the Falls? You evidently have not read the report. The thing is a
perfect sewer below the Falls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. It is not from Buffalo sewage; it is the city of Niagara
Falls sewage, which is dumped over the river bank and atomized,
sending the odor back over the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You will have to knock out of existence a great many
facts that have been shown by a scientific examination of the water if
you establish your proposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Has there been any report that it is Buffalo sewage
that has caused the difficulty or the city of Niagara Falls sewage
dumping into the lower river, with no aeration and a long trip
through the Niagara River for 20 miles or more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There must be some peculiarities about Buffalo
sewage——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I mean the water is good above the Falls but polluted
by the sewers of the city of Niagara Falls, not Buffalo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We assume the excreta from the people of Buffalo is
about the same as the excreta from the people in Tonawanda and
other places downstream.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. It is a question whether the Buffalo water has not
been purified on the way down the Niagara River for 20 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Running water might purify itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. The city of Milwaukee is aerating the water by putting
compressed air through tanks, and that is one of the sewage-treatment
propositions adopted recently. The Imhoff tank requires
all kinds of arrangements; but they claim that the compressed air
and activated sludge system is a far better scheme, using the free
oxygen in the air to oxidize the impurities of the water. So that
if Buffalo can give all these cities drinking water, and if they can
also get it on the Canadian side from the lake, it would seem as though
it would largely obviate the difficulty.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Sy</span>. Years ago I used to take the water below the Falls, and
there is practically no purification by aeration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That statement is borne out by the report. The aeration
is not sufficient. It does not purify it by going over the Falls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Just one statement in reference to that Milwaukee
sterilization plant. It is stated that they have the free oxygen of
the compressed air for the oxidation of it. But here is the proposition:
Chicago is taking care of the sewage without any treatment
whatever through a drainage canal of 250,000 cubic feet per minute,
and we have in Niagara River a natural drainage-canal proposition
of 60 times the value of that drainage canal for diluting the water,
with many, many times greater swiftness of current, or 25,000 cubic
feet per second. The drainage canal at Chicago moves so slowly you
can hardly see it. Why is it necessary to throw away the advantages
of this tremendous Niagara River drainage canal which we have
now, when it is not affecting the water, as far as the health of either
American or Canadian citizens from typhoid is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. To what extent is the drainage canal of Chicago
used for sanitary or domestic purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. It is simply a power and drainage canal; it is not
supposed to be used at all for drinking purposes. If you can not use
Lake Erie water, and if Niagara River must be used for drinking
only after treatment, then I will acknowledge it is absolutely necessary
to do something in reference to this pollution, but if it is possible
to use the Lake Erie water in Canadian towns without this expense,
it seems to me it is wise to do it; at least, for the immediate
situation. When a great city is found on the Canadian side and they
must draw their water from the Niagara River for drinking purposes,
then it is time to take action. It would seem to be a tremendously
expensive experiment to make with very little return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I want to read a paragraph from the report of our
sanitary expert, the best that could be obtained in both countries.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The examination of samples taken from cross section below Buckhorn and
Navy Islands showed undiminished pollution on the United States side. On
the Canadian side, the water, though less polluted, was still dangerous, and
should not be used without a most careful treatment; otherwise its use is
liable to give rise to periodic epidemics of intestinal diseases.</p>

<p>The results from the examination of samples collected in the gorge just
below the two Falls demonstrate that the pollution coming over is more uniformly
distributed. There is a popular impression that the action of the Falls
tends to purify sewage. It does not remove it or its dangers. It simply mixes
it more thoroughly with the water. The pollution below the Falls is gross.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Do you think your commission will recommend,
even with the expenditure of $100,000,000 instead of $3,000,000 on
the river for sewage treatment, the use of that water for drinking
purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you read the report of the engineers as to
how much was necessary to be expended for such treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are out ninety-seven millions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. The expenditure of between $3,000,000 and $3,500,000
means a vast amount to the taxpayers of this city and all those
along the frontier. Will your commission recommend, after such a
plant has been built, that water from Niagara, containing this large
amount of bacteria, regardless of the chemical treatment, should be
suitable or desirable to be taken for drinking purposes when pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
water can be delivered from Lake Erie by pumping stations on both
sides at a far cheaper rate than they can build a plant to take care
of the sewage? The small cities can not do it with the tremendous
overhead charges and the inefficiency of small pumping stations,
while we have two large pumping stations that cost, with intake
tunnel, $10,000,000, and we can supply drinking water to all the
frontier, if we only obtain the legal right to do it, cheaper than
they can pump Niagara River water even after treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is an alternative scheme you suggest. I think
we are drifting away from the subject matter. There is no question
the commission has come to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that
a condition of affairs exists on the Niagara frontier that must be
remedied; that the evil results of depositing sewage on one bank of
the stream is felt on the other side of the boundary line, more particularly
that which comes from the United States than the Canadian.
We are here having gone to great expense in the formulation
by our experts of schemes for the solution of this difficulty. We
have not absolutely adopted any scheme as yet, but we have laid this
scheme before the people on this frontier and up the Detroit River
for their consideration. A couple of months’ time has been at their
disposal to take it up and consider it. We are here to see whether
you accept it, or whether, instead of accepting it, you have any
scheme to offer in place of this; and what you have to suggest,
taking what you say at its face, is entitled to a great deal of consideration,
but we can not take your ipse dixit for these matters as
against scientific men. Is the city, and are the others who are interested,
prepared to lay schemes before us, with any data that will
reasonably back them up, for our consideration? That is the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. But you are considering the drainage power canal
from Buffalo to Lake Ontario, which means an open sewer which
you are condemning as existing in Niagara River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We are not condemning anything. From a sanitary
standpoint there is a condition of affairs which needs a remedy. Our
expert has taken into consideration all the schemes, and he has made
a report; and we have laid it before you and desire to know if you
accept it or if you reject it, and have you anything to advance as a
substitute for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I did not say you were condemning the sanitary
canal but the pollution of Niagara River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We are not condemning anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. You are condemning the pollution of the Niagara
River as an open sewer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. No. We have had <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps and others to suggest
a scheme, and we lay the results of their investigations before you,
and we ask you, Do you accept it; and, if not, have you anything to
offer in its place? We have not come to the point of deciding or
rejecting anything yet. That will arise later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Do you consider that a solution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I am not saying anything about that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. In the matter of a solution, we supply all the drinking-water
requirements without the necessity of taking the water
from the Niagara River but from Lake Erie, and therefore you have
ten times better conditions than the Chicago Drainage Canal, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
has cost $100,000,000. If you can give us something better by
spending $3,000,000 than the Chicago Drainage Canal, which cost
$100,000,000—and we have just as good a thing <span class="lock">here——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We have nothing to do with Chicago at all. We are
here for Niagara and the lake.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. O. E. CARR,<br>CITY MANAGER, NIAGARA FALLS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. I am not here to criticize the findings of the commission
in any way. I wish to represent my views and the views of the
people for whom I speak. I wish to say the city of Niagara Falls
expended something like $600,000 for the purpose of treating the
impure waters which came down from Buffalo and points beyond,
which water they had to drink. We have now in the Falls pure
water, and we do not need their water. I want to say that in the construction
of our sewer system something like a million and a half
has been expended, and that while we did not have authority from
the United States Government to construct the sewers as they were
constructed they acquiesced in that construction, and now to spend
something like $800,000 on new construction in order to treat the
waters would be looked upon by the people there as a considerable
hardship. I say that because we have already spent better than
$600,000 for the purpose of treating our waters, in order to make
them satisfactory. One point this gentleman raised seems to me to be
good. That is, that even if all the suggestions which this commission
has made with regard to the treatment of waters in Buffalo, Niagara
Falls, Tonawanda, North Tonawanda La Salle, and other places
are carried out, the waters even then in the Niagara River will not
be fit for consumption. As long as the country tributary to the
various small streams which flow into the Great Lakes and the
Niagara River are used in a more or less direct way for carrying off
refuse the waters of the Niagara River will be contaminated to some
extent; and any city will find it advisable to treat their waters before
using them for drinking purposes.</p>

<p>In regard to that same matter, that is covered very thoroughly by
the report of an investigation in reference to Cincinnati by Harrison
P. Eddy, consulting engineer at Boston. He brought out the fact
that the sewage of Pittsburgh, Liverpool, and all the cities above
Cincinnati was thrown into the Ohio River, and that all those cities
which took their water from the Ohio River found it necessary to
treat it before using for domestic purposes, and the cities below Cincinnati
would find that treatment also necessary before the water was
used, and therefore he felt—and his report bears out his feeling—that
a sewage-treatment plant for Cincinnati was at that time unnecessary,
inasmuch as the waters of the Ohio River were sufficient to
dilute the sewage which the city of Cincinnati threw into the Ohio
River to such an extent that it was not a nuisance and did not give
forth any bad odors. If it is true of Cincinnati, it is a thousand times
more true of Niagara Falls, a city of 50,000 people, and the Niagara
River, whose flow is perhaps five or six times the dry-weather flow
of the Ohio River; and not only that, but through the gorge and
rapids the tendency is to very thoroughly mix the sewage and the
water of Niagara River to such an extent that at no time would there
be any bad odor coming off from the water. I had just two points to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
make: One is that the saddling of the cost of this treatment plant,
something like $800,000, on the municipality of Niagara Falls would
be a hardship on the people, and the maintenance of that plant would
be an additional cost to the city, and I feel, as far as the city of
Niagara Falls is concerned, that city being the last city on the line,
it ought to be the last city that would be required by the United
States Government to treat its waters, and especially so on account of
the very thorough mixing of the sewage that comes from the Niagara
Falls in the Niagara River. There is one more point in that same
connection: I believe the chemical plants in Niagara Falls are discharging
into the sewers, which tends to destroy the bacteria which
normally would exist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Do you purify your water in the city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. Yes. We were disgraced by having the highest typhoid
death rate in the United States. At that time our water was not
being treated.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. R. L. SEELBACH,<br>OF BUFFALO, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr></h3>
</div>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. I would like to ascertain if it is mandatory on the
city to accept any plan the commission recommends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It would be mandatory if the two Governments, by
treaty, agreed to the adoption of the recommendation; but as far as
the commission’s recommendation is concerned it is not mandatory.
If the commission recommends certain remedies, and the two Governments,
by convention or treaty, adopt the recommendation, it becomes
the supreme law and would be mandatory upon the municipalities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. If it could be shown to the commission in a reasonable
time that a certain system would be more economical and hygienically
superior to the proposition of the commission, would that be
accepted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You appeared before the commission in 1914?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And presented a plan of treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. It was more upon the garbage proposition; but I
have taken up this matter and submitted a plan. I have a scheme to
burn the sludge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. The commission is here at this time for the discussion
of the plans submitted by our engineer, as to whether or not they
are acceptable; if not, what particular objection these different municipalities
have to the plans as submitted in this report, and we can
not take up anything that is purely outside of that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. I submitted my proposition to you people, and I
never heard anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I can say to you that it was disposed of as not coming
within the purview of our investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. I would like to know the facts in connection with
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I do not think it was formally disposed of, but that
was the consensus of opinion it did not fall within the scope of the
investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. If I can show to the city of Buffalo that my system
is more hygienic and more economical, would it have your approval?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I have no doubt it might have the approval of the
commission informally, but I doubt whether they could take it up
properly and consider it under the reference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. But the city of Buffalo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. They can do as they please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you laid your scheme before the city authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. Not as yet; I would like to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You have not as many men to deal with as you had
years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. If the commissioners could find my statement there,
I would like to make a correction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We have not it with us. You can address the secretary
at Washington, or see him here personally, and give him any
corrections you want to make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I was going to make the suggestion that you might
be allowed to make your correction at this time, if you care to. But
we have not your statement here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. I can not make it without the statement before me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. We do not seem to be getting anywhere; we are
traveling around in a circle. I submit this proposition to you—whether
or not we could take a recess, and your engineers or your
representative men and our engineers spend the remainder of the day
in going over this report, to see whether or not you can not come in
here to-morrow with some tentative agreement at least as to what
your differences are, whether they are irreconcilable, or what may be
the prospect of coming to some understanding with each other. I
want to repeat again that, under the terms of the reference, this commission
has nothing whatever to do with the supplying of pure water
to any of these municipalities. The question referred to us is to determine
whether or not these boundary waters were polluted to the
injury of health and property on the other side of the line, and if
they were—and it has been clearly demonstrated that they were—what
remedy we would advise and submit to the two Governments for
their adoption. We are anxious to have the cooperation of the people
here in Buffalo and elsewhere to work out a plan possibly that will
answer the terms of the reference and make it as easy as possible
for the people interested here and elsewhere. That is what we are
here for. The commission could sit down in its offices in Washington
or Ottawa and develop a plan, but we want to consider you people
here; we want to work with you to devise a scheme that will be best
for you and acceptable to the Governments at the least possible cost.
That is my idea of the situation in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I would suggest that Mr. Seelbach prepare a typewritten
brief and give a copy to each member of the commission. If
his idea is good, I, for one, would like to take advantage of it and
have it considered, but you understand we can not adequately consider
any scientific scheme here by simply an oral statement. You
had better typewrite your brief and submit it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. I can submit it. How long will you remain here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. We can remain here two or three days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And if it is not ready you could send copies to the
Washington or Ottawa offices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. I would like to suggest that we have not heard from
all the officials of Buffalo. <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton looks as though he had
something to say, and it might be well to fill in time hearing what
these people have to say.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>STATEMENT OF CAPT. GEORGE H. NORTON,
<br>CITY ENGINEER, OF BUFFALO.</h3>
</div>


<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. I have had the honor of appearing before you several
times in this matter, and at the earlier hearings I believe that
you asked the city of Buffalo if we had any plan to suggest at that
time, and, as city engineer, I said to you that I thought the ordinary
procedure would be for you to hear the outline of such results as you
expected should be accomplished, and I believe that was the opinion
and advice of your sanitary consulting engineer—that the commission
should outline a tentative policy and submit such to the city,
and I am very much pleased that that has been done in the excellent
way in which it has been done. In speaking of the plan itself as
worked out in detail by Mr. Tolles and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps and your commission,
the general plan for Buffalo for the collection of its sewage
has followed the idea which the city has had as the probable solution,
accepting the suggestion of your Mr. Tolles, which looks very
reasonable—that we divert certain of our sewage from the easterly
side of the city to the southern outlet instead of our middle outlet
in Niagara River. That is a matter which can only be determined,
as to its extent and advisability by making detailed plans both ways.
That is a matter which will require careful engineering estimate.
I believe Mr. Tolles has gone through that to some extent, but I do
not think to the extent of the estimate of the parallel construction.
That, then, would bring us down to the question of the extent of
treatment, if such is to be undertaken. The suggestion which I have
made heretofore was somewhat in parallel with what Mr. Carr has
suggested, that there is one limiting condition of pollution in the
Niagara River which, I believe, is not thoroughly covered by the
examination of the experts as to the condition of pollution, and that
was whether or not the pollution from surface drainage at times did
not materially exceed the proposed limitation, that the conditions
here at times make this river less desirable by reason of surface pollution;
then we have a limiting factor in there which we have not
met in the tentative plans proposed by the consulting engineers, and
I think it should be given consideration in this study; that is, that
you have at times conditions from surface drainage pollution which
will exceed the limitation set up by sanitary engineers as one to be
worked to in treatment of it. I think the engineers will agree that
if you have that condition existing 10 or 15 days a year, which is
detrimental to the citizens, it is not the average condition, but should
be given consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Is there any material increase in the sources of pollution?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. It would be in keeping with the normal population
of the community. It is different here and on the other side of the
river. I believe the normal rate of increase of pollution over there
is not as great as that of the cities. The extent of this treatment as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
recommended, I would say, would be rather more than I would have
in mind for the city of Buffalo as being a solution of the problem,
for this reason, that the report of the sanitary expert, which established
a condition of water which might not impose an undue burden
on the water-filtration plant, is based on the average pollution of
the entire cross-section, and I should think that was a very reasonable
solution for the smaller stream, but the question comes with the
larger stream, where we can get a thread of water which is materially
less polluted than the average, as to whether that should be given
material consideration in a stream as large as this; that, instead of
putting our basis of 500 B. coli per cubic centimeter over the whole
cross section of the river, whether we should not take that for the
whole section of the river, which is liable to furnish variable water
to the various municipalities along the stream, allowing for all contingencies
in the way of change of currents at various times. These
are broad problems which can only be settled by the highest advice,
and it would be well for the city to have that advice and go over
these two or three different points before accepting in toto that extent
to which the clarification or purification should be considered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That is what the commission did. They advocated
the employment of the best sanitary engineers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Besides the plan you have been speaking of, what
would you say as to whether or not the commission would be justified
in recommending to the two Governments that no raw sewage be
deposited in any of the boundary waters?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. I believe that principle is correct, and that there
should be some sewage treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You do not think these international waters should
be used for discharging raw sewage from the cities bordering on
them?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. No; I do not; and that is the consensus of sanitary
opinion at the present time—that such a thing should not be allowed.
With regard to Mr. Perkins’s suggestion as to furnishing the water
supply along the Niagara frontier, I have a reference to my first
suggestion which I made to you when the matter was first submitted
to the city, which you will find in the hearings of the International
Joint Commission, in the document of 1915, on pages 41, 43, et seq.,
when that matter was discussed on behalf of the city as a possible
solution. I am not in a position to speak as to whether the city of
Buffalo would want to insist on that as a solution. It is one of the
probable and reasonable solutions of the whole problem, but I suppose
we are dependent upon your action in covering the conditions
as they exist at large along the waterways. You must make some
reasonable recommendation that will cover the whole situation, and
if you do that what your attitude would be in regard to making an
exception here would be an open question. There are many problems
here, and I do not think the city has had a chance to give it detailed
study. If they wish to go into this and arrive at a reasonable
solution it might be well for the city to have some expert advice and
go over the matters in detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has the city of Buffalo in the last year been making
any study of this problem independent of the study made by the
sanitary engineers of the commission?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I did not know whether Buffalo had or not.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you think the city council or commission, whichever
it is, will act upon your advice and take steps to obtain expert
advice with respect to the modification which you suggested in regard
to the plan proposed by our sanitary engineers?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. I think the council can answer better themselves.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. CHARLES B. HILL,
<br>COMMISSIONER OF FINANCE AND COUNCILMAN, OF BUFFALO.</h3>
</div>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I might take the liberty of speaking for the new council
in that regard, and in answer I would say that we have a very high
regard for our engineering department, and I have no doubt the
council would follow the advice of the department in that respect.
Of course, I am not in a position to speak authoritatively as to the
policy of the new council.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. My reason for asking is this: We have had this matter
under consideration now for about three years, and if the city of
Buffalo contemplated in the near future taking up the study of the
problem along the line suggested by <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton, the commission
might hereafter delay final report until we had the judgment and advice
or the conclusions of your city. It is not the desire of the commission
to arbitrarily make recommendations without taking into
consideration the wishes and the desires of the various communities
affected. We want to give them a reasonable time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think the council feels that it is its duty to cooperate in
every way with this commission and to take this matter under advisement
in the way that <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton suggests. For myself—and I am
in the same position as the other commissioners—I may say we took
office only the 1st of January. This matter came to our attention only
when the notice came in, and we have had time but for one informal
discussion with the engineering department, so that, as a representative
body, we are unable at this time, as I feel, to do justice to the
matter at this hearing. I agree with the suggestion of the commission,
and I think that that is the disposition that ought to be made of the
matter, and give us time to take the matter up, which we will do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Speaking for myself, we want the cooperation of the
two large cities on our side of the line in working out this problem,
so that when it is worked out and embodied in our recommendation
it will reasonably meet the approval of the people of these two great
municipalities; and in that case it would be comparatively easy for
the two Governments to follow the recommendations and make the
necessary provisions. In that case our work will not be futile, otherwise
it might go for naught. For that reason we want the cooperation
of both cities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Absolutely right, and I take the liberty of speaking for
the council, and I say we are of a mind to give that cooperation, and
we will certainly do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Can you give us approximately the time you will
require to consider it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. You all know how such matters go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Or, rather, don’t go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I can say the matter will not be neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you done anything since you got the report in
the way of considering the recommendations, or having them considered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We had one meeting and one discussion with <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
Norton occupying over two hours, perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Will you really take it up seriously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We will, because we appreciate the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. This thing has been hanging three years.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>STATEMENT OF DR. FRANCIS E. FRONCZAK,
<br>HEALTH OFFICER OF BUFFALO.</h3>
</div>


<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. First of all, I want to congratulate the commission
and engineers on the excellent report published in the document issued
last March. It shows a most thorough study, and also shows
that, notwithstanding statements made this morning, there is greater
contamination below than above—at least more contamination. But
there is one thing forgotten by the engineers in this report apparently
that <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton has mentioned—that the surface drainage
is not considered. I do not believe any city is justified in turning
raw sewage into any stream of that kind. But even if we do treat
sewage that way, we will still have an immense amount of surface
drainage from contaminated streams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You mean outside of the cities?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. No, not outside; and that surface drainage will
have to be considered all the time; in other words, no matter what is
done about the disposal of sewage, you still must purify the water
after it gets to the mains for drinking purposes. In Buffalo we have
most excellent results; and I want to place in the record of the
commission the fact that the use of chlorine gas has considerably
reduced the number of typhoid cases in Buffalo. Last year, 1915,
shows that, notwithstanding the fact that Buffalo was larger and
more populous than ever before, we had fewer cases of typhoid fever
than ever before in the history of the department of health. We
had fewer deaths from typhoid in Buffalo last year than at any time
in the history of the department. We had this year, from January
1 to June 20, only 61 cases of typhoid in Buffalo, and only 16 deaths,
which is so low that the United States Government, the New York
State department of health, and the scientific societies have complimented
the city on the results attained, and this was due to the purification
of the water supply by chlorine gas; and that is a thing that
must be considered all the time on the question of pollution of these
streams, not only the removal of the solids, the sterilization, or the
removal of as much pollution as is possible, but the removal of danger
of contamination from surface drainage. Incidentally I might state
that since August, 1914, when the chlorine gas was used in Buffalo,
the total number of bacteria, which, I believe, have run into thousands
day after day in Buffalo, have fallen as low as four per hundred
centimeters; and while in former years we had colon bacilli in
the water, since 1914 to date only on one single day did we find colon
bacilli. So that shows conclusively that the use of chlorine gas, the
way we are using it, renders the water more safe, and that this will
have to be considered in connection with the pollution of these streams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. When did you commence the use of chlorine gas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. August, 1914.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Two years?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. Yes; only on one single day in all this time did we
find colon bacilli where we formerly found it repeatedly, and the
death rate of Buffalo for typhoid fever to-day is below 10 per
100,000 population. The fall has been so steady the last five years,
and especially within two years, that the State department of health
sent congratulations to the mayor of Buffalo and to the department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What was your death rate before?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. Seventeen, 19, 25; last year it was below 10. It is
growing less all the time, and Buffalo is a growing city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Were there any other changes made in your system to
which any part of this could be attributed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. Yes; the new tunnel. With the construction of the
tunnel we found a difference, and the fly exterminator contributed
some. But the use of chlorine gas is the best investment Buffalo has
made for the reduction of death rate that I know of.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. We started using water from the new intake in
January, 1912, but it was not used entirely. There was some water
used from the old intake. For 1912, 1913, and 1914 the death rate
was 13½ per 100,000, and for the 10 years previous to the opening of
the new intake it was 24½. So that we had a reduction prior to the
introduction of chlorine gas of 12 per 100,000, and last year it was
10, and this year it is below that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You can not attribute the favorable result entirely
to the use of chlorine gas?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. Two things. The other is getting into the best
thread of the current, which was done on the advice of Mr. George
Fuller, and that worked out well; and one of the points I tried to
bring out before your commission—that where you had the thread of
the current, which was apparently pure, compared with the remainder
of the stream, perhaps the average condition over the whole
thread of the current would impose somewhat of a hardship on the
city of Buffalo in the way of reduction of 90 per cent which you
propose here, which seems to me too high.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fronczak</span>. I would like to place some figures before the commission
as to the death rate in Buffalo, as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Seelbach</span>. I refer you to a journal published by the Society of
Economic Industry, of London, England, dated June, 1915, a lecture
given by J. Grossman on the disposal of sewage sludge. The article
is very long, and I will quote the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is to be hoped that draining this enormous waste of material which should
go back to the land, and which represents a value of at least £2,000,000 per
annum in this country, will not continue indefinitely, and that it will be recognized
that sewage sludge is a national asset which should be dealt with by the
Government in the interest of agriculture, to which a cheap and inefficient
manure will be of incalculable benefit.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I will call attention to a statement by the commissioner
of health of Chicago, Ill., that “For the 10-year period preceding
the opening of the tunnel the typhoid rate was 57.9 per
100,000, and after the opening of the tunnel it was reduced to 5.39
per 100,000. I believe not only the drainage canal but the introduction
of chlorine gas had an effect on that.” This is from the remarks
of John Dill Robertson, commissioner of health of Chicago, Ill.,
published in the Congressional Record. Here it is a question of
international boundary streams; but what is there so sacred or so
holy about international streams that they are different from the
Mississippi River, where they encourage the introduction of all the
Chicago sewage and everything into the river? There are millions
of inhabitants on that river who take that water for drinking purposes,
where here we are expected to spend two or three millions for
sewage treatment, for the benefit of whom? On the American side
they have the chlorine proposition, which has reduced the death rate
of Niagara Falls. Here you have investigated the proposition years
ago, before the chlorine gas was available for the sterilization of
the water, and it is said we must decide on spending $3,000,000 of
money to avoid pollution of Niagara River. It is entirely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Can something practical come out of this? If you
have a scheme to submit, put it on paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Inasmuch as all drinking water can be supplied
from Lake Erie, for various purposes, that is a solution in itself.
We have already a solution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Tell us what the cost of the trunk main is going to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Merely a few thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Down to Niagara?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. Through to Tonawanda, on this side; and this
water-pipe line becomes the means for the distribution of a greater
city, with its suburbs, which must have water anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I doubt very much if $50,000 would dig your ditch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. I am simply talking of the main; I am not talking
about the Canadian side; but I said $50,000 or $100,000 would carry
the necessary water main for Tonawanda, or even as far as Niagara
Falls, depending, of course, upon its size, providing for the future
needs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We want facts, not the imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Perkins</span>. The engineers could state this better; but it would
be a mere bagatelle as compared with $3,000,000 for the sewage treatment
necessary, and then the river water would not be desirable for
drinking purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Could <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps make a statement in regard to
the cooperation we are seeking and the desirability of it, and also
what the gist of the reference is. It should be fresh in our minds
before we talk ourselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We have had it from <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton and the others.
Ask the authorities of Buffalo city exactly what they want. Do
they want a postponement of the hearing; and if so, how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kreinheder</span>. How long would it take your engineer to make
this study?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Your engineers are working with them. They collaborated
on this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. The work the city did was in furnishing the information
and discussing the differences here. We had a good many
talks over the local conditions and getting such ideas as they had.
There was no work done by the department of public works on the
report further than a discussion in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And it takes a much shorter time to revise than it
would to work out the scheme in the first instance.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. I do not suppose you would care to have us work
out another plan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I was going to suggest that it might not be necessary
to have a further hearing, as I understand <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton and
Mr. Hill. What they contemplate doing is employing sanitary
experts or engineers to go over this matter and consider such modifications
as were suggested by <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton this morning, and their
conclusions could be submitted to us in the form of a report to us
without any further hearing. As I understand it the city of Buffalo
does not wish to have any more hearings, but they wish to submit
some considerations based upon reports from sanitary engineers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. That would be my engineering idea, and in connection
with that suggestion it would occur to me that the other cities
might join in an examination of that kind, so that we could have
their ideas.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I am not able to speak for the council of Tonawanda
or North Tonawanda, but I think that suggestion is a very good
one, and they might cooperate in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Mr. Hill, you and the commissioner of public works
were authorized to speak for the city in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I believe we were, informally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The only point is that we have been so long over this
there will be a good deal of criticism in regard to it. Now, we want
a matter of hard and fast business. We do not want to hurry you
at all, but to have some definite understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In regard to that, after Mr. Tawney made some remarks
to <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton, I thought perhaps I should say, speaking
for myself, and indirectly for the council, I would not want it understood,
so far as I am concerned, that we are committing ourselves
to a possible modification of the plan that has been suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It is not so understood by me or anybody else. I
used that merely as an illustration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I wanted to avoid any possible misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George Clinton</span>, Jr. The last remarks made brought to my
attention something that has been running through my mind during
this hearing, and that is that it might be of some assistance if the
city officials clearly understood the scope of this investigation. I
have no doubt perhaps they might, but I confess I have not been
able to get it clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We were just going to call on <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps, our
consulting engineer, to make a statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George Clinton</span>, Jr. I wish to ask one question in regard to
it, and I will be through. The sanitary experts of the commission
have determined that the city pollutes the water of the Niagara
River by the discharge of sewage, and they have recommended certain
means of stopping that pollution. Now, is not the province of
this commission to determine the result that is to be obtained—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
is, the cessation of that pollution—leaving it to the city authorities
to determine the means of putting a stop to it, with the advice
merely of the commission? Is that statement correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Not exactly, as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That has been my idea all along, but that is not the
idea of the majority of the commission. My idea is that we should
demand or ask for certain results. As to how those results are to be
brought about, leave it entirely to the judgment of the municipalities.
But we have gone further than that and have had the methods
investigated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. This is merely to show they are practical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The second clause of the reference clearly indicates
that the two Governments expect the commission, in its final report,
to recommend to them what remedies are advisable or necessary to
prevent the pollution which we found existed in contravention of the
treaty. The second clause of the reference reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In what way or manner, whether by the construction and operation of suitable
drainage canals or plants at convenient points or otherwise, is it possible and
advisable to remedy or prevent the pollution of these waters, and by what means
or arrangement can the proper construction or operation of remedial or preventive
works, or a system or method of rendering those waters sanitary and
suitable for domestic and other uses be best secured and maintained in order
to insure the adequate protection and development of all interests involved on
both sides of the boundary, and to fulfill the obligations undertaken in Article IV
of the waterways treaty of January 11, 1909, between the United States and
Great Britain, in which it is agreed that the waters therein defined as boundary
waters and waters flowing across the boundary shall not be polluted on either
side to the injury of health or property on the other?</p>
</div>

<p>So that we must not only determine the effect of the pollution, but
we must also recommend a remedy, and in order to recommend a
remedy we have had these investigations made by the engineers and
studied the problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">George Clinton</span>, Jr. I had construed that as requiring a recommendation
that was merely advisory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is right; it is advisory and not mandatory.
That is for the Governments to determine after we render our advisory
judgment. It is then for the Governments to say whether that
advisory judgment should be executed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Answering the question of the commissioners as to the
time the city may require to make this report which has been suggested,
we would say six months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Do you suggest that we hold another hearing in the
city of Buffalo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; we acquiesce in the suggestion of Mr. Tawney in
that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps, we have a few minutes left before
recess, and the commission will be glad to hear any statement you
may desire to make.</p>

<p><a id="PHELPS"></a>
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Mr. Chairman, my suggestions are contained in this
progress report, and I can only in the briefest way allude to the main
features for the purpose of summarizing the whole matter and, perhaps,
clarifying the present status as I see it.</p>

<p>When the commission met last in Buffalo, about a year and a half
ago, it had arrived at the conclusion, based upon what is possibly
the most elaborate investigation of stream-pollution conditions ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
made, that the Niagara River, in common with other frontier rivers,
was being polluted in contravention of certain treaty rights. At that
time the commission had had suggested to it by its engineers the
proposition that it should prepare plans and make recommendations
to the cities. The commission had not acted upon that recommendation,
but had it under consideration. The cities were heard at that
time, and the city engineer of Buffalo stated that it was the duty of
the commission to make the first definite suggestion rather than to
ask the city what it proposed to do on the mere statement of the fact
of pollution.</p>

<p>The commission undertook thereafter the investigation of which
you have just received the final report. It was not the purpose in
making this investigation to attempt to determine the most feasible
plan of remedy; it was merely the purpose to determine a feasible
plan, a plan which, in the opinion of the engineer, would satisfy the
requirements of the commission and would serve as a suitable remedy,
under the terms of the treaty and the reference, for the conditions
which the commission had found to exist. It seemed satisfactory to
us if we could determine, as a result of the comparatively brief survey,
a single suitable solution of this problem. In the search for such
a solution many alternative plans were naturally investigated. I
think the commissioner is a little mistaken in his suggestion made
here that six alternative plans have been presented to the city for consideration.
We have in fact presented all the facts and figures in
connection with our studies, but definite recommendations along a
single specific line are made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That simply means that you consider six schemes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Yes, sir; and selected from those six the one that
seemed to us the most advisable. We do not pretend that this rather
brief engineering study is a sufficiently complete one for the city’s
needs. We do not doubt that, with the fuller engineering studies
which will be necessary on their part before any plans are adopted,
they will be able to arrive at even more satisfactory results than we
have reached. The progress of sewage purification is so rapid that
since the beginning of this investigation processes have been developed
that look to-day most promising, and which may, before we
arrive at any final conclusion in this matter, demonstrate a very great
saving in expense. These things we have had in mind and have fully
considered, but our purpose has been to show that at a certain definite
figure the city can accomplish the results desired by the commission
and by the two Governments.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish that result the commission first felt it necessary
to interpret the terms of the reference, which were somewhat
indefinite. It is stated in the reference and also in the treaty that
the waters shall not be polluted on either side of the line to the injury
of health or property on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. May I interrupt you to inquire if that international
burden is greater than the ordinary national burden?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. It is not so great; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I thought you might bring that out.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. It was not so simple to determine just <span class="lock">what——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Pardon me. You say that the burdens imposed by
the treaty on communities like the city of Buffalo are not so great as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the law of the United States or the law of Canada would impose upon
these communities. Is that what you mean?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. No, sir. May I return to that point later? I was
about to say that it was not self-evident in the terms of the treaty
and the reference just how much pollution could be permitted without
permanent and definite injury to the health and property of those
on the other side. It was necessary to seek advice upon that point,
and it seems to me that that point is the only one susceptible of any
difference of opinion. It must be understood, in the first place, that
rivers of this sort can not be maintained in their pristine purity.
They must serve for the natural drainage of populous areas, and they
must be polluted to a greater or less extent. Furthermore, the city
sewage can be treated to almost any condition desired. We can make
drinking water out <a id="chg1"></a>of it if we want to, but the cost would be prohibitive.
We can purify it to any degree varying from mere screening up to the
drinking-water standard.</p>

<p>Now, how much pollution shall we permit in these rivers—how
much ought we to permit, considering the economic aspect of the
situation, and also to comply with the obligations of the treaty?
Upon this point the commission sought the best engineering advice
available, and obtained a definite statement of a limiting standard
of purity beyond which it was deemed unwise to go for drinking-water
supplies.</p>

<p>Now, there is no question here of using these supplies in their raw
state; it is assumed to be the duty of all cities using these rivers to
purify them to the best of their ability. It was only proposed that
the rivers should not be polluted beyond a fit condition for further
purification for domestic purposes. It is the most moderate and
conservative standard that we can possibly propose.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this point of departure with respect to a standard,
which is capable of some flexibility, and is, after all, only an
opinion, the remainder of the work was purely an engineering study
of the means necessary to accomplish the desired results. Those
means, as I have stated, we have studied in some detail. We are
satisfied that our figures are correct. We are satisfied that the city
can do what has been recommended to the commission within the
estimated cost. As I have stated, we believe they can do it for less
money. The progress of sewage purification and the necessary additional
engineering studies will undoubtedly bring about further
economies. We are content, however, to rest upon the figures given.
We believe that those figures are a reasonable and justifiable burden
to impose upon this city.</p>

<p>Now, as to the standard itself. That is, of course, open to discussion.
It may be too severe. The city of Niagara Falls seems to be
quite content to purify this water as it is to-day. Other cities are
not. There are upon record several cases of water filters or purification
plants, treating water worse than our proposed standard, which
have on occasions failed. The best engineering devices fail at times,
and the water filter, or a sterilization plant, is at most a fallible
engineering device. It is fairly satisfactory, but at times it fails,
and it is our duty as sanitarians to provide a raw water for treatment
at such plants of a character which will not impose too much of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
burden upon the water plant, which will not reduce the margin of
safety below a reasonable point.</p>

<p>We had all these matters in mind in fixing the standard alluded
to, and if any further discussion is desired as to the reasonableness
of that standard, we shall, of course, welcome it.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton’s suggestion this morning that instead of considering
the entire cross section, we should consider the fact that the water
is naturally better in some strips than it is in others, seemed to me
to be a point well taken. Of course that is not a matter that we can
deal with in figures. The only way we could handle the matter in
figures was to assume that the sewage was mixed throughout the
cross section, and it is shown in the report that that is probably the
most extreme assumption. It gives us the worst water, because if
it is not mixed throughout the cross section, then there are necessarily
better and worse streaks than the average, and the better streaks
would be available for a source of water supply. On the other hand,
the flow of water in streams or lines is a matter which is not capable
of definite engineering study. It is a matter which can be discovered
only by experimental work on the river, and it is a matter upon which
we do not dare to place too much reliance. There are in most rivers
changes in the channels, in the drift of the current as effected by the
direction of the wind; then various elevations and rates of flow
modify the drifts to a certain extent. So I think we should be a
little cautious in assuming that there are available at all times
streaks of water better than the average. I do not doubt that there
are in most cases just such conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps, are these purer streaks, as you call
them, continuous or liable to change?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. They follow, in general, lines parallel to the river
channel. As the river channel bends, if there is a heavy pollution on
one shore, it tends to keep on that shore. The farther downstream
we go the less definite become these stratifications.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. But these purer streams that Mr. Norton spoke of?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. They follow too. The whole flow tends to be in
parallel lines. Between here and Niagara Falls there is very definite
evidence that the pollution tends to hug the shore and the water in
the center of the river remains for the most part relatively purer.
Below the Falls, in the gorge and the whirlpool, there is a complete
mixing, so that with respect to the water supply below that point
we would have to accept an average mixture.</p>

<p>Now, in answer to Mr. Magrath’s question regarding these standards
from an international viewpoint and the question of how much
pollution crosses the boundary waters, I would say that the standards
are much less severe than they would be if we had to consider the
local situation. On the other hand, Mr. Powell mentioned the national
laws. The State and National laws are very weak in our
country, as is evidenced by the present situation, so that our international
requirements as contained in these standards are more
stringent than existing laws, but if a proper law against stream
pollution, or any standards such as the commission is considering,
were adopted by the Federal Government the local requirements
would be more excessive than the international requirements. The
pollution, in any event, tends to keep on the same side of the stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
That is, it does not cross the boundary in any such concentration as
exists along the shore of its origin.</p>

<p>The question has been raised here and seems to have been left a
little bit in doubt as to whether the recommendations and particular
devices of this report shall be mandatory. My personal opinion is
that in general they should not. If the city wishes to take advantage
of any of the newer processes of sewage purification and can save
money thereby, we say Godspeed. We want you to do it. The
commission wants to accomplish and is obliged to accomplish certain
things, and it wants to see those things accomplished in the
most economical manner. On the other hand, I think the gentleman
who last raised this question had in mind the proposed drainage
canal. That would, of course, accomplish all that is desired so far
as the Niagara River is concerned. The commission is obliged to
look beyond that, however, and if it is not satisfied that that remedy
would accomplish all that should be accomplished as regards Lake
Ontario, and if it is also convinced, as has been recommended, that
that remedy will not be a satisfactory one from the point of view of
the citizens of New York State, then I do not think that the commission
would feel justified in accepting that as an alternative, even
though it seemed more desirable for this immediate locality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What have you to suggest about the pollution from
surface drainage which has been discussed here this morning and
which it is claimed your report does not deal with?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. I recall that <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton raised that point at our
last hearing, and I have been unable to see that it is of very serious
significance. There are two distinct classes of drainage which come
under that classification, and I have no doubt <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton has
them both in mind. First, there is the drainage of the rural community
about here, and it is undoubtedly the fact that the little
streams and brooks which flow into the river in this region in times
of bad weather contain a great deal of surface wash and are undoubtedly
highly polluted. Capt. Norton mentioned that specifically
at the last hearing in this city. Then, there is the second class—the
run-off during storms. It is an obvious source of pollution. In regard
to the first matter, consideration of the populations existing in
these rural regions in comparison with the populations of the cities
will show, just from the point of view of the human population and
human pollution, that their total effect must be rather small. The
effect of animal pollution, while it is undesirable and places a load
upon water filters, can be dismissed as regards direct effect upon
public health and the quality of drinking waters.</p>

<p>The most serious aspect is the storm-water overflow from the city
sewers. There is a very serious and heavy pollution, and in the
present state of our knowledge it seems to me is one that we have
just got to let pass.</p>

<p>I do not quite agree with <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Norton, if I understood him correctly,
that the maximum condition of pollution during heavy storms
fixes the limits or should in any way modify our limits of pollution.
This is a thing added to all the rest. If we have a certain amount of
sewage coming in we have something added in time of storm. That
something may be a large thing, but it does not occur very many
times in the year. Our computations show the actual amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
sewage discharged in storm overflow during the year to be but a very
few per cent. It surely is our duty to cut off the main source of
pollution from the public sewers, even though we do have to ignore
this storm wash which we admit is serious at times.</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. If I may interrupt on that one point, I had that
in mind, especially in connection with the threads of the currents
which gave us the pure and impure waters, and that largely entered
into the element of pollution at times.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Your thought is that the storm flow tends to mix
those streams more than they would naturally be mixed?</p>

<p><abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Norton</span>. No; but that was one of the elements that would
give us the average. Some of the elements of our street washing
from our sewers was confined largely to the shore line and did not
reach any thorough admixture.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. In making these averages we used our best ingenuity
to get a fair average from the analytical results. It is, of course,
a difficult matter, and my only satisfaction in thinking that these
averages are anywhere near correct is the fact that after the detailed
study to which they were submitted they seemed to agree very well
among themselves and as between the various cities. The pollution
per capita of population in the Niagara River agreed very well
indeed with that in the Detroit River, and I think, on the whole, by
averaging the many thousands of analyses we were able to arrive at
a fair statement. But you will recall that the individual figures did
vary enormously. I have no doubt that the analytical results included
a certain amount of this storm wash, and that the degree of
purification which we have asked for will not probably bring down
the result quite as low as we would figure. On the other hand, I
do not think that the additional pollution due to storm wash is
many per cent of the total and its significance is certainly not in proportion
to its amount. I believe that is all I have to say, Mr.
Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there anyone present from Tonawanda or North
Tonawanda? Lackawanna, I understand, was represented here this
morning. Perhaps the representative of the State board of health,
Mr. Chairman, will have something to say this afternoon.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Is there any particular question you wanted to ask
with reference to Tonawanda or North Tonawanda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We wanted to know if the suggestions made in the
report are satisfactory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do not know whether they have any representative
here or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. They were notified, and they can not complain that
the commission did not give them an opportunity to be heard.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. You spoke about the chlorination of water. I think
one of the most remarkable instances of reduction of typhoid fever
in treating water with chlorine gas was manifested in the city of
Lockport. Getting water from the same source for the 12 months
before they used the chlorination process they had 53 cases of typhoid
fever, and in the 7 months after chlorination of the water in
the following year they had 3 cases. The Tonawanda, North Tonawanda,
and Lockport intakes are all in practically the same thread
of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What effect has chlorination upon the potability of
the water?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. There is a difference of opinion with regard to that.
A great many people in Buffalo complained of the chlorine tasting
in the water before the chlorine was ever put into it. After it was
put in they did not complain. Dr. Fronczak received dozens of
letters asking that they stop using chlorine when there was no chlorine
whatever being used. The amount of chlorine that is necessary
to destroy pathogenic life can not be tasted.</p>

<p>Speaking of this surface-water drainage I think that is a question
that applies more largely and more directly to smaller communities.
It is well known that in some of the rural communities there have
occurred some of the greatest typhoid-fever epidemics that we have
ever had. In Plymouth, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr>, there occurred one of the greatest
typhoid-fever epidemics that the world has ever seen. A little trout
stream was contaminated by a patient that came in there. The discharges
were simply not disinfected by the physician or the nurse,
but were thrown out upon the ground, and when the spring rains
came a serious epidemic occurred. An epidemic through surface
contamination occurred at Ithaca. I think it applies more to rural
communities. The State Department of Health of New York
has recommended the chlorination process, and I think it has been
proven beyond any peradventure that if the apparatus is carefully
watched and the proper amount of gas is liberated into the water
it is almost a sure preventive of typhoid fever, but an apparatus
such as is manufactured now becomes corrupted to a certain extent,
and unless cylinders are provided for weighing the chlorine you
can not rely on the automatic weighing. Through the North Tonawanda
intake recently we had quite a number of cases of typhoid
fever, and by positive demonstration we discovered that they were
using less than half the amount of chlorine they were supposed to
use because the treating apparatus did not work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The State Board of Health of New York has had this
report of the consulting sanitary engineer now for some two months
for study. Have you given any study to the problems that are discussed
in that report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That would be a matter beyond my jurisdiction. It
would be taken up entirely by the engineer division of the department
at Albany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you know whether or not they have studied those
problems?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Located here, I have charge of five counties in western
New York. I represent the department locally, but I am not connected
very much with the Albany office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps, I would like to have you bring out
clearly before the gentlemen present the object and policy in making
your studies. It was not with the idea, I presume, of imposing on
the city of Buffalo or the city of Detroit any particular system, but
it was to show to both communities that the result you thought advisable
could be worked out at a certain cost, and if they could work
them out more cheaply than that it is not your purpose to interfere
with them. Was that your idea?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is one object. The other was in the capacity
of an adviser to point out some feasible method by which it can be
done if they choose to adopt it, and I understand you to say that they
might, by further study, reduce the cost or make changes in particular
features of the scheme which might be more feasible than
even the scheme which you have recommended?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(Thereupon, at 1 o’clock p. m., the commission took a recess until
3 o’clock p. m.)</p>


<p class="p2 center">AFTER RECESS.</p>

<p>The commission reconvened at the expiration of the recess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Gentlemen, the principal purpose of the session this
afternoon is to afford an opportunity to the representatives of any
of the cities and towns in the vicinity of Buffalo that were not
present this morning to appear at this time and be heard in their
own behalf with respect to the report of the consulting engineers.
Tonawanda and North Tonawanda are two of the principal towns,
I believe, that were not represented this morning. Is there anyone
now present representing those communities? If there is no one to
be heard, I do not know of anything further.</p>

<p>It is the wish of the commission to have a conference before leaving
Buffalo, if possible, with the mayor and the members of the city
council on this subject, with a view to seeing just what can be done
to facilitate the matter of their considering and reporting to the
commission their views with respect to the remedies that are proposed
by our consulting engineer. I understand that they are engaged
officially this afternoon in the council chamber.</p>

<p>(Upon the arrival from the council chamber of the members of the
city council the commission went into executive session.)</p>

<span class="smcap r4">International Joint Commission,</span><br>
<span class="r2"><i>Detroit, Mich., Monday, June 26, 1916</i>.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The commission met at 10 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p>Mr. Gardner presided.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Gentlemen, in calling this meeting to order I think
I can truly say that the International Joint Commission obtain as
much pleasure in coming here to Detroit at this time as it is possible
for any body of men to receive that are engaged in trying to analyze
and work out to a practical solution a question of the nature of the
one that brings us here. We are especially glad because of the good
spirit that has been manifested by the people of Detroit and this community
in times gone by.</p>

<p>As you know, the two Governments referred to this commission for
determination the question as to whether or not the boundary waters
or waters flowing across the boundary were being polluted in contravention
of the treaty, in which they agreed that the waters on
neither side of the line should be polluted to the injury of health or
property on the other. The commission in determining the first
question of the reference employed that eminent bacteriologist, Dr.
Allen J. McLaughlin, who made the investigations. Early in 1914<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the commission issued a progress report in which it was very clearly
set forth that the waters along some portions of the boundary were
being seriously and grossly polluted. Following that the commission
employed <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Earle B. Phelps in reference to the second part
of the reference, which requires this commission to report to the two
Governments—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In what way or manner, whether by the construction and operation of suitable
drainage canals or plants at convenient points or otherwise, is it possible
and advisable to remedy or prevent the pollution of these waters, and by what
means or arrangement can the proper construction or operation of remedial
or preventive works, or a system or method of rendering these waters sanitary
and suitable for domestic and other uses, be best secured and maintained in
order to secure the adequate protection and development of all interests involved
on both sides of the boundary, and to fill the obligations undertaken in
Article IV of the waterways treaty of January 11, 1909, between the United
States and Great Britain, in which it is agreed that the waters therein defined
as boundary waters and waters flowing across the boundary shall not be
polluted on either side to the injury of health or property on the other.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps completed his work some two months ago, and
copies of the report have been submitted to the authorities of the city
of Detroit and the other municipalities involved in this investigation.
The commission thought it advisable, before issuing its final
report to the two Governments, to come here and have a conference
with you to see in what way, if any, there is going to be any serious
disagreement in regard to the projects submitted by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps. I
say projects, because he has submitted in five different methods or
plans his ideas as to how this result can be best obtained. We have
come here this morning with the expectation that you will take up
these several projects and discuss them with the commission to show
wherein, if in any way, we differ and whether or not such differences
can be reconciled.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the discussion of these several projects I
will ask the secretary to read the call for the meeting.</p>

<p>(The secretaries then read the notice of the meeting to be held at
Detroit which was sent to interested municipalities and officials in
the United States and Canada, together with copies of the report of
the consulting sanitary engineer of the commission, and also the list
of municipalities and officials to whom said notice and report were
sent.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Mr. Chairman, we were notified of the meeting
to-day, but we had no notice of the time at which the meeting would
be held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The notice that was sent to the mayor stated that
the meeting would be held at 10 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. The mayor had been out of the city for several
days, and about a week ago he came home sick. He has been ill
in bed ever since. He hopes to be at the city hall some time to-day
if possible. He intended to be here at the beginning of your meeting,
and his absence is accounted for by his sickness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Well, he has relied, I presume, for his information
upon the studies of those problems that were made by yourself and
your assistants, has he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I may say that Mr. Hubbell’s report was turned
over to the printers as soon as received. A copy of my letter transmitting
the same to the council and the summary in his report were
printed in the council proceedings. We have not received printed
copies of his report yet. Mr. Hubbell, the engineer who made our
investigation, told me this morning that he hoped to have copies by
noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is Mr. Hubbell here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. He is not here. He will be here some time this
morning. He came in and asked me what time the meeting would
be held, and I told him that I had not heard, and he went out. That
was about half an hour ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What time do you use here, eastern or central time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. We use eastern time. I sent notices to the members
of the board of health, the health officer, the sanitary engineer, members
of the board of water commissioners, their secretary and general
superintendent, the common council, members of the committee on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
health and city hospitals, members of the committee on sewers, Mr.
Hubbell, and perhaps others. I told them of the meeting to be held
to-day, but I did not state any time. Very likely a notice giving
the time of the meeting at 10 o’clock was received in my office, but I
do not remember seeing it. It is probably an oversight on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Rich, before beginning the hearings the commission
would like to know what the relation of the State is to the
public health and the sewage question of the city of Detroit. Has
the State board of health supreme control?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That, Mr. Commissioner, is set forth in a law known as
act 98 of the public acts of 1913, of which I think we furnished you a
copy some two years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. When we were here before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. As we understand it, that gives the State board
of health authority to order whatever changes may be deemed necessary
in any water in the State for purposes of public health.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has that authority been questioned heretofore by
the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not in court. I do not know whether it has elsewhere
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mayor Marx, have you any information on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marx</span>. I do not recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The matter of Highland Park was involved to some
extent, but that has been settled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. So up to the present time under the existing law the
State board of health has the power to order any remedial measures
that it may deem necessary to protect the public health?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is the way we understand the law, and that was
the intention when it was passed. It has not been definitely tested
in court yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. At the suggestion of the chair we will proceed to
hear the representatives of the State of Michigan with respect to the
remedies that are proposed by the consulting sanitary engineer of
the commission. It is our understanding, Mr. Rich, that your office
has been giving considerable attention and study to the various alternative
plans proposed by the consulting sanitary engineer of the
commission. I think it would be advisable to hear the representatives
of the State first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the commission, I
regret to say that we have not given the alternative plans very much
consideration. We have not had the report long enough to be able
to do so. It seems to me that the function of the office which I represent
is to judge not so much the economical features that arise with
respect to the various questions coming before us as the sanitary
features, although we are always glad to give the municipalities what
assistance we can in the economical solution of their problems. But
we understand that the law first contemplates our passing upon the
plans from the sanitary standpoint and giving our opinion as to
whether or not they will produce the results desired, with perhaps
not very much regard to the cost, although as engineers we could
hardly pass by that important feature as a matter of conscience.</p>

<p>We have been very much interested in the studies being made, and,
in fact, have done quite a little in the way of investigation ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
since the termination of the work of this commission. We have in
progress now a report of our studies of the municipalities below
Detroit, having for its object the determination of the factors entering
into the production of the abnormal typhoid death rate which
has existed for a number of years. A careful study has been made
of each particular case so far as we were able to find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How long before your report will be printed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Probably two or three months. After that we expect to
proceed to remedial measures at once; that is, the different municipalities
will probably be called before the State board of health for
a hearing, giving them a chance to express their opinion as to what
should be done and what they are willing to do; and if they are not
willing to do anything, or if they seem to be too slow, undoubtedly
the State board of health would set a time within which they must
conform to its orders. That has been done to some extent already
with the city of Monroe, and proceedings are going forward as rapidly
as we could expect there for a purified water supply. Some
steps are being taken looking to the treatment of sewage. We hope
that similar results may be obtained in the other municipalities below
Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you adopted any standard for purification of
sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We feel that we are indebted to this commission for a
very fine determination of that point, and I might say that we are
practically relying upon that entirely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Then you agree with us in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We have accepted the views of your consulting engineers
almost entirely. We feel that it was very wise indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you gone sufficiently into the proposed remedies
for sewage disposal to enable you to express any opinion whatever
with respect to the efficiency of the remedies proposed by our
consulting engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In a general way; yes. From what we have been able
to learn with regard to the proposition for screening sewage and
afterwards treating it with a disinfectant we would not feel sufficient
confidence in that to recommend it. The other methods proposed
we would concur in. We concur in the judgment of the engineers
with reference to the methods, but regarding the particular
location of plants we are unable to express our opinion at the present
time owing to the fact that we have not gone into that as carefully
as we would like to do. In fact, I hardly think we would have
time to go into it enough to feel sufficiently justified in expressing a
very definite opinion as to the particular location of plants; in other
words, as to the economics of the question, but we do feel like approving
fully the views of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps, Mr. Hubbell, and Mr. McRae
in these matters. I think they will agree with me that screening is
hardly to be relied upon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you given any consideration to the proposed
consolidation of the various villages around Detroit into one general
or Detroit metropolitan sanitary district?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I have given some personal thought to it, but there have
been no steps taken as yet looking toward a special investigation of
that matter. I am very much interested in it. I am at the present
time very much in favor of a thorough study as to the feasibility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
such an organization. I believe it is the only feasible solution of the
whole problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. From an economical standpoint, do you think it
would be advantageous both to the city and to the surrounding
municipalities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I do, yes; and I think it would be advantageous from
every standpoint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are you conducting your studies, then, with reference
to the consolidated sewage district suggested by the consulting
sanitary engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; we are not. We have not gotten as far ahead as
that yet. We are simply studying the present condition, and whatever
we recommend will probably be of such a nature that no great
amount of money would be lost if consolidation should be effected
later, but it would be more immediately available for the alleviation
of existing conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are you contemplating any improvement in the
matter of sewage disposal for the city of Detroit independent of
any recommendations of this commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; we are not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you made any bacteriological examination of
the waters of the Detroit River independent of the examination which
was made by our bacteriologists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We have made some this summer in connection with
the water as it is supplied to the other municipalities, not making a
study of the river as a river, but, taking it as it comes through the
means of these municipalities below, we have made some studies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How does your examination compare with the examination
of the cross sections of the river made by our bacteriologists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. They could not be compared, because all the water that
is taken from these intakes comes from a single point in the river.
We have not taken any samples in the river any more than last year
we took some few samples from the western end of Lake Erie which
coincided in a general way with the findings of the bacteriologists
of this commission, except that our samples were taken at other
points and showed what might be expected from theirs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. As the chief State sanitary engineer, what would
you say, Mr. Rich, as to the thoroughness and completeness of the
work of the consulting engineers in their study of the problems that
are involved here in the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I think it has been very fine, indeed. I do not believe
I could speak too enthusiastically upon that point. I am very much
pleased, indeed, with the results obtained and the way in which the
work was done, and that especially in connection with Mr. Hubbell’s
work on the part of the city. It is a fine thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You feel that we were justified in undertaking the
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I do, indeed; and I think it is a great contribution to
the future as indicating the way in which such problems ought to be
attacked and worked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you given any consideration to the disposal
of the sludge that would be the result of screening and sedimentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not any more than our general reading of the subject.
We have not made any studies of local conditions. Sludge obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
from fine screening would probably need to be disposed of by incineration
or else taken to a long distance from the city and buried; but
probably that would be too much for the city of Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The city of London has installed, and the city of
Glasgow, Scotland, was about to install when the war broke out, a
system which makes it a decided success from an economical standpoint.
They <a id="chg2"></a>produce a lot of chemicals from the sludge. You have
not given any attention to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. You do not know what they produce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes; some of the things they produce are gasoline,
carbolic acid, and a pitch. I think there are nine by-products that
they dispose of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I am not familiar with the details of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I understand you to say, Mr. Rich, that, while you
have read the different alternative plans or remedies proposed by
our consulting sanitary engineer, you have not given them sufficient
study to determine what, in your judgment, would be the most desirable
and the most economical in practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I do not think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You do not desire to express an opinion on either
one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Only that I think we would be justified in saying that
we believe the tankage method, followed by sterilization, would be
superior to screening methods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. That is, you prefer the process of sedimentation
to that of fine screening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is it. That is as far as we would feel justified in
going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any opinion to express as to whether
there should be one hour or two hours of sedimentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No. I think that would depend considerably upon the
character of the sewage. We have made no tests whatever of the
time required for the Detroit sewage. In fact, we have made no
tests of any sort on the Detroit sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have any of your assistants anything to offer independent
of what you have set forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The two men who made the actual studies down the
stream from here are present, and if you would like to hear from
them at this time or at a future time they will be available. Mr.
Follin had charge of the field work in the investigation at Ford
City, Wyandotte, and Trenton.</p>


<h3>
STATEMENT OF MR. JAMES W. FOLLIN, OF DETROIT,<br> ASSISTANT
TO THE STATE SANITARY ENGINEER.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, the survey which Mr.
Rich has explained to you and which Mr. Waterman and I made at
Ford City, Wyandotte, and Trenton, was made primarily to determine
the conditions existing in connection with the high typhoid
death rate in those communities and to determine what should be
done to remedy those conditions. I have here a digest of the work
as we planned it and carried it on which I will go over with you.
The necessity for these surveys was shown by the high typhoid death
rates in these communities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawnet</span>. What were those death rates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. They are given in this statement which I will read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A sanitary survey in the villages of Ford and Trenton and in the city of
Wyandotte has recently been made by E. L. Waterman and J. W. Follin under
the direction of the State sanitary engineer and by authorization of the State
board of health. The necessity for such surveys was shown by a study of the
typhoid fever death rates in these communities. This study disclosed the
following facts:</p>

<p>In Ford the average death rate during the period of 1904-1915, inclusive,
was 364.5; the maximum was 849, occurring in 1907; the minimum was 126,
occurring in 1908.</p>

<p>In Wyandotte the average death rate during the period of 1900-1915, inclusive,
was 87.2; the maximum was 144, occurring in 1913; the minimum was
12, occurring in 1911.</p>

<p>For Trenton the average death rate during the period 1904-1915, inclusive,
was 94.8; the maximum was 243, occurring in 1913; the minimum was 0,
occurring in 1905, 1910, 1912, and 1914.</p>

<p>The objects of these surveys were to determine in each community—</p>

<p>1. The general sanitary condition.</p>

<p>2. The quality of both private and public water supplies.</p>

<p>3. The adequacy of present sewerage systems and the extent of their use.</p>

<p>4. The amount of typhoid fever and probable reasons for its presence.</p>

<p>The surveys were begun on February 15 and completed on May 1, 1916. They
were carried on simultaneously in each community. Frequent bacteriological
tests on the public and private supplies were made, the location of existing
sewers was determined, also the number and character of connections to them,
the history of the typhoid-fever cases occurring during 1914, 1915, and the first
four months of 1916 was ascertained. A study of the data collected shows that
the following conditions exist:</p>

<p>The village of Ford obtains its water supply from the Detroit River through
an intake located at the harbor line. This water is supplied to the consumers
without treatment. A 12-inch and 42-inch sewer empty into the river above
this intake and a 36-inch sewer discharges at a point some distance below. A
private sewer from the industrial plant of the Michigan Alkali <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> discharges
into the river at a point about 50 feet downstream from the water intake. Float
measurements made at a time when a southeast wind was blowing showed that
the effluent from this sewer was undoubtedly carried past the water intake.
The results of bacteriological analyses on the village water showed that it was
badly contaminated at all times and at no time fit for drinking purposes. The
histories of typhoid-fever cases in Ford showed that in practically all cases the
infection was obtained from the village water supply. There was a remarkable
absence of secondary or contact cases. The general use of outside closets
which discharge into the sewer, but which are not provided with flushing
devices, is to be deplored.</p>

<p>The city of Wyandotte obtains its public water supply from the Detroit River,
the intake pipes extending out a distance of approximately 150 feet from the
shore. In March, 1914, hypochlorite of lime treatment of the water was begun.
Our bacteriological analyses show that out of 35 tests the treated water was
satisfactory in only 15 instances, or 43 per cent of the time. The city sewerage
system has four points of outlet—all into the river, but at points below the
water intake. Many of the connections to the sewers are of the same nonflushing,
outside closet type that is prevalent in Ford. The typhoid-fever case histories
all point to the city water supply as the probable source of infection. There are
a few private water supplies which are obtained from wells. An examination
of these supplies shows that most of them are uncontaminated at present.</p>

<p>The village of Trenton gets its water supply from the Detroit River, the
intake pipes extending out about 200 feet from the shore line. This water is
supplied to the consumers without treatment. Bacteriological examinations
show that this water is polluted at all times and absolutely unfit for drinking
purposes. There are many private wells in Trenton and nearly all of them
show sewage contamination. This is probably due to the fact that there is no
general sewerage system in the village and consequently outdoor privies are
common. Where plumbing has been installed the sewage is carried to open
drains in most cases, where direct connection to the river is not feasible. There
are 20 private sewers emptying into the river above the water intake, and the
village authorities have recently decided to add a public sewer to this number.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
General sanitary conditions in the village are exceedingly poor and the village
authorities seem very unconcerned when these conditions are called to their
attention. The study of the typhoid-fever cases occurring in Trenton during
1914 and 1915 shows that a majority of the cases are due to the polluted public
water supply, but that some may be attributed to general insanitary conditions,
such as open drains, outside privies, and polluted well supplies.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
REMEDIAL MEASURES.<br>
</p>

<p>Filtration of the public water supplies is necessary in all these localities.
It is advisable to install intercepting sewers in Fort which will carry all sewage
to a point near the southern boundary of the village where a treatment plant
consisting of Imhoff tanks followed by chlorination should be installed. This
will protect the Ford water supply from contamination by sewage from the village
and also lighten the load on the Wyandotte water filtration plant. Better
raw water can be secured at Wyandotte and Ford by the extension of the
intake pipes into the river channel. The best location for the intakes can only
be determined by a careful investigation of the quality of the water at different
points in the cross section.</p>

<p>At Trenton filtration of the public water supply and a general sewerage system
which will properly sewer the entire village and carry the sewage to a
point well below the water intake are the essential measures immediately necessary
for the proper safeguarding of the public health. As Trenton is the
farthermost downstream community of importance, we do not feel that a treatment
plant is necessary at the present time. However, we shall insist on a
design for the sewerage system which will contemplate treatment of the sewage
should such treatment become necessary in the future.</p>
</div>

<p>Below Trenton on the Michigan side of the river we have only one
city of any size; in fact, only one community which takes its water
supply from water which is affected by the Detroit River. That is
the city of Monroe, of about 7,500 people. It is situated on the River
Raisin, which obtains its water from the western end of Lake Erie.
The studies made by the engineers of this commission have disclosed
the fact that the sewage of the Detroit River contaminates the
waters of Lake Erie to a point as far as the islands which separate
that portion of the lake from the rest of Lake Erie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How many miles is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. I do not know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. About 18 miles, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. It is probably a little farther than that. Last summer
we made an investigation with respect to typhoid fever conditions
at Monroe and found that although not started by the city
water, the city water then did spread an epidemic of typhoid fever
in the town. We made some investigation of the waters immediately
in the western end of the lake next to their waterworks intake and
found that they were not of sufficient quality to enable the water
there to be made fit for domestic purposes by chlorination alone. We
accordingly called a meeting of the State board of health, at which
the officials of Monroe and the officials of the Monroe Water <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, a
private company, were called in for consultation. They expressed
their willingness to go ahead and complete the filtration works for
the city. Those details are now being worked out. No definite order
was made by the board of health in that instance because it was not
deemed necessary.</p>

<p>So our statement that possibly the village of Trenton alone need
to immediately treat its sewage is based on our local conditions along
the Michigan shore and not on any study of conditions that might
exist on the other side. But our recommendations to them are that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
their plans be so drawn that treatment works can be installed when
necessary. Trenton is now very seriously in need of the installation
of a good public water supply, and we would certainly endeavor to
hasten the time when they can have such a supply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. All the sewage of these cities that you have mentioned
is deposited in the Detroit River in a raw state?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. In a raw state; yes, sir. There is no treatment whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. They are all below the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. They are all below Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are a sanitary engineer, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are a graduate of the State university at Ann
Arbor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. I am a graduate of the State university at Ann Arbor;
yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How long have you been in practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. I have been with Mr. Rich, at Lansing, for one year
and have been graduated three years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you given any study at all to the report of
our consulting sanitary engineer in regard to remedies for the pollution
of the Detroit River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. I have given only general consideration to it in the
same way that Mr. Rich has, realizing that your problem <span class="lock">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. From the study that you have given to it, what
have you to say as to the thoroughness of the work that was done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. We consider that the work has been very thoroughly
carried out, and that the recommendations made are very feasible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Does the State Board of Health of Michigan agree
with the sanitary experts generally that no raw sewage should be
deposited in any stream that supplies other municipalities or localities
with water for domestic and sanitary purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. Personally we feel very strongly that way, but we
realize that those opinions can not be forced within a very short time
onto the municipalities in Michigan; but such an ideal condition
must come slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What have you to say as to the standard of purification
recommended by the consulting engineers in this progress
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. I do not feel that I am in a position to comment on
that, although from the little study I have given the matter I believe
it is very reasonable. I might explain one other thing. Our reason
for studying only Ford City, Wyandotte, and Trenton below Detroit
on this side of the river and not studying the river at River Rouge
and Ecorse was because the Detroit water supply is furnished to
River Rouge and Ecorse and that the river supply is first used below
Detroit at Ford City. It was our intention to first study those conditions
because they related to the purity of the water in the Detroit
River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I understood you to say that in one of these municipalities
in which the water was treated it was found afterwards on
examination to be unfit for drinking purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. Yes; I did say that. During the course of our investigations
we made 35 examinations of the treated water at Wyandotte,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
covering a period of several months. During that time we found only
15 of those samples to show the water fit for drinking purposes only
35 per cent of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is, after it had undergone the process of sterilization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. After it had undergone the treatment of hypochloride
of lime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you figures as to the condition before it underwent
the treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. We have those figures. In no case was the raw water
fit for drinking purposes without treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Can you give the result of your bacteriological examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. We have a report now under preparation which will
give these figures in detail, and we hope to have that out within several
weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You can not speak from memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. Yes; the raw water was not fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But that is a general statement. Do you remember
how many B. coli to the cubic centimeter there were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Follin</span>. We have not that data with us; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Will your other assistant have the figures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would like to have Mr. Waterman speak with reference
to the attitude taken by the municipalities which we investigated.
The statement read by Mr. Follin is the advance sheet of our
report. It is the conclusions that are come to in our report. The
report will contain more than this contains, but this is a digest of
what will be the findings.</p>


<h3>
STATEMENT OF MR. E. L. WATERMAN.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. I can not add very much to the statements which
Mr. Rich and Mr. Follin have already made, but I would like to
say something in regard to the attitude which the village and city
authorities in the places which we have investigated have taken
toward these surveys. We found that at Ford village the authorities
were very enthusiastic toward this investigation. They evidently
wanted to learn just what the conditions were, and they were
eager to get our opinions as to the means of correcting the conditions
now existing. At Wyandotte the city authorities showed
some enthusiasm, but we did not find them as enthusiastic as we
felt they should have been over an investigation of this kind. I
might say that the city of Wyandotte has been struggling with the
problem of public water supply for some eight years, and that during
that time many bacteriological examinations and chemical examinations
of the water have been made at the State board of
health laboratory, and at one time a consulting engineer was employed
to make preliminary plans for a water filtration plant; that
this proposition was defeated by a vote of the city; and that since
that time very little has been done. The only thing was the introduction
of a hypochlorite of lime treatment in March, 1914. As
already stated, our investigations showed that a hypochlorite treatment
is not adequate to give the city of Wyandotte a safe water
supply. In the village of Trenton, I am sorry to say, the attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
of the village authorities has been more unfavorable than favorable.
They do not seem to realize the importance of improvements
in the sanitary conditions, and we have met with very little cooperation
from the authorities themselves. I think that this is about all
that I can add to the statements already made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you think there is any growing interest in this
matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. I should say that in Ford village and Wyandotte
there is undoubtedly a growing interest, and that among a very few
people in Trenton, that you might call thinking people, there is a
growing interest, but the general attitude is not favorable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. They are not all thinking people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is one point you are clear on, and that is that
chlorination is not sufficient for the purification of the water down
there for drinking purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It would have to be supplemented or preceded by
sedimentation or screening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. You are speaking of the water itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. We feel that filtration of the water supply is
necessary, followed by chlorination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is this contamination of the waters of these various
places due to the sewage which they themselves deposit in the
water raw, or is it due to the pollution that is put in above raw,
that goes farther out in the stream?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. In the case of Ford City, I would say that the
sewage of the village itself undoubtedly contaminates an already
polluted supply, and the same is true of Trenton, although undoubtedly
the pollution which enters the river from the city of
Detroit is more or less mitigated before reaching Trenton. At Wyandotte
the sewers are all below the water intake, but the sewers
from the village of Ford are above and undoubtedly pollute that
supply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How far above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. I would estimate the nearest one was about a mile
above the intake, and there are two others within a distance of 2
miles from the intake, both entering directly into the river at the
harbor or dock <span class="lock">line——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And the intake at Wyandotte is how far out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. The intake at Wyandotte is approximately 150
feet out, so that whatever pollution comes in at this point 1 mile or
2 miles above would probably be diffused that distance from the
shore at least, probably more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is exactly the position taken by the citizens
of Trenton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. I do not think the citizens, as citizens, have had
very much opportunity thus far to express themselves on the question.
It is really the village authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Well, substitute in my question “the village authorities”
for “the citizens”; what position do they take exactly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. They take the position that everything is all
right down there, and that there is no reason in the world why they
should not go on putting in sewage in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. They are not impressed by the statistics which
have been read here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. Those statistics have not yet been presented to
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Nevertheless they have been informed of those
facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. Yes; they have been informed of the facts, and
the majority of the village council have, by their acts, shown that
they do not appreciate those statistics which have been brought to
their notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What exactly were the powers of the State board
with regard to a city like Trenton, in order to compel it, if necessary,
to take the necessary measures for water purification or treatment
of sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. The powers of the State board, I think, have
been outlined by Mr. Rich, and if I repeat, I am trying to repeat
what he said, that the State board has the power to order any improvements
in the sewage systems of the village necessary in the
opinion of the State board for the betterment of public health.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. No such order has been given so far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. No. We feel, and are rather certain, that such
orders will be given, if necessary, after the completion and adoption
of our present report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I suppose they would rather run the risk of death
than face the certainty of increased taxation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. That seems to be the opinion, although one useful
fact has been brought out by our investigations, and that is that
the old residents of these towns and cities are, for the most part,
immune to typhoid fever. It is the newcomers who come on, usually
within six months time of taking up their residence there, who are
liable to take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The old ones are immune.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. They have either had it some time in the past
or have become so used to the water supply that the typhoid germs
diffused into their system do not affect them at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is such a thing as being immune from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waterman</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I may say, Mr. Rich, as you are aware, the commission
has had before it since August, 1914, the pollution investigation.
We have carried on two distinct pieces of work. I am not
looking for any compliments to the commission, but, as the representative
of the State of Michigan, are you willing to go on record,
first, as to the value and character of the work which we have done
under the two branches of the investigation, and, second, the diligence
and thoroughness with which both have been conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am heartily so. I believe that there has been no
previous examination of this wide character and extent carried on
anywhere—at least, none has come to my notice—and I feel that
the work of the commission has been of great value to us in our work,
not only in the specific material studied and the ground covered
but in the general principles evolved from that study. We feel that
we have been equipped with ammunition that is going to be very
useful to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You mean useful throughout the State?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; and for all time to come, as assisting us in formulating
our policy in a great many cases. We also feel that the investigation,
after the first study, has been very thoroughly carried
on, indeed. Mr. McRae’s studies here were prosecuted with keen
insight into the requirements of the question. As far as speed is
concerned, I do not well see how the results could have been obtained
any more promptly than they have been. The only delays that I
have been able to notice in the procedure from the start to the finish
was while the material was in the printer’s hands, and I do not see
how that could be construed as delay in the ordinary sense. There
was the unavoidable wait for the material to be placed in such shape
that it could be put before the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Dr. McCullough, you represent the Province of
Ontario, which has jurisdiction along the water front, has it not?
Can you give the commission any opinion with respect to the work
of the Province in connection with the subject and water purification
on your side of the line?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Would you like me to outline the policy of the
Province?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes. We have had the policy of the State on this
side and it would be appropriate to have the policy of the Province
of Ontario on the other side.</p>


<h3>
STATEMENT OF DR. J. W. S. McCULLOUGH,<br>OF TORONTO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. In the Province of Ontario the provincial board
of health has control of the establishment of waterworks and water-purification
works, sewage works, and sewage-disposal works of all
kinds. No water plant can be established by any municipality or by
any individual for public use unless the consent and approval of
the provincial board of health, to which body all plans must be
supplied, is obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How long has that condition existed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Since 1912; it exists in its present state since
1912. It did exist previously for some years, but not in a satisfactory
condition. No municipality can raise money on debentures
without the approval of the provincial board of health for works of
the character I have mentioned, and we have further power to force
extensions. We have also power, under certain circumstances, to
allow the municipality to establish works of this kind and raise
money without the consent of the people, and in a number of cases
that has been done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Without limitation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Without the vote of the people and without any
limitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Except the exigency of the case.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Yes; it is the policy of the board, of course,
as a rule, not to interfere in that way, but to have the people vote
on a money by-law. Now, there is another way a municipality can
establish works of utility, and that is by having a two-thirds vote
of the council. It is a sort of local improvement; that is, for extension
of sewers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. The provincial council?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. No; the municipal council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has your board recently made any surveys for the
purpose of ascertaining the conditions along the Detroit River on
your side in regard to the villages or cities located there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. We were concerned in making the first progress
report. The Provincial Board of Health of Ontario, as you will remember,
supplied laboratories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You were associated with Dr. McLaughlin in that—you
and Mr. Dallyn?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I thought it was well to get in the record the policy
of the provincial board.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. The policy of the provincial board is, broadly
speaking, along public-health lines. We are satisfied that the water
supplies are accountable for a good deal of disease of an intestinal
character, and it is our object to lessen the amount of pollution of
the boundary waters as much as possible and have the waters purified
as much as possible. Just recently we have been able to secure
a purification plant at Niagara, on the Lake, where there is a military
concentration camp, under an arrangement of this kind. The
municipality is bearing half the expense and the Federal Government
is bearing the other half, because it is such an important matter
from the point of view of having the troops there supplied with
good water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is that water furnished to the municipality generally,
or simply to the camp?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. At Niagara-on-the-Lake it is a municipal water
supply. They simply pump it from the Niagara River and clarify
it. It requires to be very heavily chlorinated, because it is badly
polluted. Then, in addition to that, the military authorities have
provided this year a portable violet-ray plant, whereby the water
supplied for cooking and drinking purposes to the soldiers’ camp is
purified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. That is merely for the water supplied to the
camp?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Yes; but not that will be further improved by
the town having a filtration plant, the cost of which will be borne
jointly by the Federal Government and by the municipality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do they take the water from above or below the
Falls?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Niagara-on-the-Lake is at the mouth of the
river, away below the Falls; about 12 miles below the Falls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Some members of the commission had the advantage
of seeing the filtration plant at the camp last week.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. That is the violet-ray plant. It does the work
very well; but, of course, it is only a small affair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is filtration in connection with that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Oh, yes. That plant was designed by the engineer
of the provincial board of health, and by him supplied to the
military authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the standard of purity that your board
of health follows?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. With regard to the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes; standard of purification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. We think that, for these international waters,
there should be sedimentation and chlorination. We would be satisfied
with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The standard of purification is 90°, is it not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. The standard as to purification for <span class="lock">water——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I mean for sewage. What is the standard for sewage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. I think it is something like that laid down
in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I wanted to find out if it corresponded with the
standard established by the engineers in this report.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. We would be satisfied with that; but we are not
satisfied to confine it to two areas, as proposed in the report to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Two areas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. That is the Detroit area and the Buffalo area.
We think there are other points to which the investigation and purification
should extend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It should not be limited to these two areas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Would you kindly say at what points on the international
waterways you consider these methods should be employed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. I think at all the points indicated in the first
progress report. In that report this commission says that the waters
are polluted to the detriment of either one or the other side. We
think the commission should stick to that, and carry along its work to
include all of these areas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You are just reiterating the position you took at
Washington?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Exactly, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Dallyn, you are the chief engineer of the Provincial
Board of Health of Ontario, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Yes.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. F. A. DALLYN,<br> OF TORONTO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I am the provincial sanitary engineer, attached to
the Provincial Board of Health of Ontario.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you anything to add to what Dr. McCullough
has said regarding the policy of the Province with respect to the
purification of sewage and water for domestic and sanitary purposes
in these boundary waters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. There is one matter, I think, that is worthy of further
note, and that is as to whether it would be any advantage to
either the municipalities, the Provinces, or the States, to be restricted,
as they are in the report of the commission, to a specific method of
meeting the commission’s requirements. There seems to be some
doubt as to the proper way to interpret the reference—as to whether
the commission is supposed to report some definite way in which a
standard is to be attained or whether the two Governments meant
that a prescribed standard could be reached at a reasonable expense
through at least one method. Speaking as an engineer, not as the
engineer of the Province, I would say we do not want to be hampered
by any restriction in that respect on the part of the commission. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
do need a standard of purity for sewage effluents. It is very necessary.
We can hardly advance any further without one, but we do
not want to be hampered by any particular way of arriving at any
desired result. As to whether we will adopt two hours’ sedimentation
and Imhoff tanks, or a different type of tank, and one, two, or
four hours’ sedimentation is a question that requires study for each
separate municipality. It will depend upon the character of the
local sewage. And with the developments that are taking place in
sewage disposal it is quite conceivable that half an hour’s sedimentation
may be a practical limit, with some particular type of tank.
We do not want to be tied down to two hours’ sedimentation. And
then as to the method of sterilizing the effluent, your report indicates
that bleaching powder, or liquid chlorine, will be the agents to effect
this. Possibly we will not want to be hampered by a provision as to
these. The experiments at Milwaukee indicate that a higher bacterial
removal than you are calling for on these waters can be obtained by
aeration of sewage by the activated sludge process. This method
may not be practical at all centers; it will be practical at some.</p>

<p>That is just the position, I think, that most of us engineers will
take with reference to your report upon remedial measures. We are
very much in sympathy with the effort toward setting a standard of
purification for these boundary waters. It is needed. Some of us
feel that the only feasible and practical way of accomplishing the desired
end is by standardizing the sewage effluent, by saying just what
percentage of matter in suspension you want removed and what bacterial
removal you want. I think the sewage treatment standards
suggested by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps are practical ones and will occasion very
little disputing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You do not want to be hindered from going as far
as possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. We certainly do not, sir. As to the construction and
location of interceptors, of course, it is recognized by the engineers
that the commission has had a very difficult problem, and that, with
the time available, they have made a very valuable report as to the
feasible way of handling the question, but there are a great many
studies that will be required to be made before a municipality should
be tied down to any particular route. Your proposal may show the
natural route to utilize, but there might be difficulties in construction
which can not be anticipated, without a great deal of survey work, by
testing the substrata, finding what is below, whether sand, rock,
quicksand, or clay, which might be overcome by deviating from the
prescribed route, even though the excavation were heavier. Surveys
can not be made in a short time. I feel also that our municipalities
heretofore have not had appropriations with which to make investigation
as to whether the routes suggested by you are practicable.
The money that the commission has expended on this work, of course,
is not adequate to make a very minute survey; and when you realize
that in order to examine this report properly each of these municipalities
has to spend from $10,000 to $20,000 you realize that it is
quite a large undertaking for them to do at a very short notice. It is
work that will require probably a year to investigate. I believe that
is all I desire to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You mean, by further investigation, having soundings
and test pits along the route?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Oh, yes; and by cross sections of sewer, whether it is
cheaper to use brick, or concrete, or vitrified block. There is a good
deal of research work to be gone into before deciding upon work costing
large sums of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You speak of the purification of the effluent up to a
certain standard. Would you have that standard fixed without regard
to whether the effluent is flowing into a small or large stream?
Can you fix it absolutely, without regard to the size of the stream,
or the quantity of water that was in the stream to dilute it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. The sedimentation part of it should be fixed absolutely.
I do not see any difficulty in doing that. There appears to be
no practical or structural difficulty in requiring a certain percentage
removal, or a given number of parts per million, of residual suspended
matter. As to the number of bacteria to be removed, I think
that could be more flexible, depending entirely upon the use the
stream was to be put to, whether as a channel of commerce, or used
largely as a pleasure resort, or whether it had no particular value in
either of those spheres. We have in our Province a great deal of
trouble by reason of townships complaining against the discharge
or raw sewage, or even treated sewage, from some of the municipalities,
saying it affects cattle. It is a disputed matter, but they certainly
have the law on their side, and can compel the municipalities
to purify to a much greater extent than some of you might think
advisable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the growing consensus of opinion in respect
of the purification of the effluent before allowing it to go into the
stream?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Well, there seem to be two schools—the school of
cranks, asking a high standard, and the conservation school, who
want to use our natural resources to the utmost extent, and who sometimes
overlook some of the changing factors which are not usually
taken into consideration. I belong to the school of cranks, as I told
you before, and I would like to see some better standard adopted
than might immediately appear necessary, as in education we require
to learn more than our vocation appears to demand when measured by
practical methods of the conservation school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Great Britain seems to head the movement in purification
of streams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. They have much smaller streams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It is a different problem, on account of the different
quantity of water in the streams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. They lack the water-supply problem, and have to
treat the sewage from the æsthetic point of view more than any
other. I have in mind the ability of the stream to take up the putrescible
matter, without giving out odors. In places where several
centers must utilize the same stream there must needs be a more
intense purification than where one center only enters it. With your
problem the purification as to bacterial removal will have to be some
function of the population in the congested centers. In other points,
like Sarnia and Port Huron, the bacterial degree of pollution is not
very heavy, not reaching the 500 standard <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps recommends
as being considered a contravention of the treaty, and the function of
population does not amount to very much, so here you would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
treat it very much better than you apparently need. As a rule, when
you use chemicals to disinfect sewage, you get no action at all until
you remove about 60 per cent. You get a 60 per cent removal or you
get nothing. It seems to be inert; and then you have to increase your
quantities till you get up to 100 per cent removal, the last 10 per cent
taking almost half as much again as the 90 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Your idea is that under no circumstances should there
be any discharge into the large or small stream without purification to
the extent of sedimentation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I believe our civilization has reached a point now
where, as far as self-respect goes, we are required to separate the
gross solids from the liquid matter before discharging them into any
stream.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you desire to be heard at this time, Mr. Sloman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Not necessarily at this time, but at such a time as is
convenient to the commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do the representatives from any of the cities on the
United States side wish to be heard before taking recess?</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. MASON L. BROWN,<br>RIVER ROUGE, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. As the representative of the River Rouge Village, I
wish to say a word. I have also been authorized to make objections
for the village of Ford and the city of Wyandotte. My objections
have been placed before the commission by the gentleman who has
just spoken, and I think I can add nothing more to his remarks. The
objections are purely local and are engineering features, and as to
the desirability of purifying the sewage before entering into the
stream, I think all these villages are in accord, and very anxious to
do whatever is right and necessary on that. In regard to River
Rouge, I may say that we have a separate system there. We realized
what was coming some six years ago, and we provided for it, and all
we have to do now is to put in the purification plant. Our objection
in regard to River Rouge is a local one, and the engineer who has
just spoken has outlined it, and if we are not tied down to the exact
locality, as shown on your engineer’s plan, we are thoroughly satisfied.
We would rather object to the location, if we have to follow
his suggestion. We can only say that the present pumping plant
there is ample, without putting in an intercepting sewer, saving some
$20,000 odd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are the municipalities you are now speaking for included
in the proposed consolidated sewage district, referred to in
this report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. They are not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Then the plan for sewage treatment recommended
by the consulting engineers does not apply to the municipalities you
represent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. It does. The Rouge and Wyandotte are both specifically
mentioned, and it is for those I am speaking. We are very
anxious to have this carried out. It is simply a matter of local detail.
We would like to have some changes, and we would get the
same and possibly better results and at a great saving to these cities.
In other words, we could do away with the interceptors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any plan to suggest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Taking the report of your engineer as it stands, it
calls for an intercepting sewer. The treatment plan is per capita,
and the maintenance the same. In looking over this report I find
there is very little difference in regard to the cost of construction and
maintaining the treatment plan for either a small population or a
large one. In other words, in the village of Ford we have three outlets,
and instead of building an intercepting sewer, tearing up all
their pavement, why could we not put in those three plants, dividing
it up, providing the figures in that report are correct? The same as
to Wyandotte. I am simply taking the report as it stands. I do not
see any necessity for an intercepting sewer.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. I may merely say, in reference to what Mr. Dallyn
has said, that it is not anticipated that we would be fortunate enough
to find in our brief survey the most feasible and the most economical
plans. There is no intention of insisting upon the plans specifically,
and if the cities and towns interested are able to save money and accomplish
the result the commission desires to accomplish, we say Godspeed.
It is results we are after. It is quite proper that the city shall
take advantage not only of their more detailed and accurate engineering
knowledge of the local situation, but also of those tremendous
improvements in sewage disposal which are going ahead so fast it is
difficult to keep track of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Take that particular point of treating all the sewage
at one point, or at three points; that is, having an intercepting sewer
or not having one.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. The engineer can advise him if he is correct. My
personal experience would lead me to doubt whether he can save
money by building three plants instead of one. However, if he can
save money let him do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I just took the statement of the report itself. It took
so much per capita and disregarded the population entirely. We have
never made an detailed figures. This came up hurriedly, and we have
nothing to suggest. We are heartily in favor of the improvements,
but in regard to the commission tying us down as to details, we would
like to know how much limit we have if we get results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any objection to or criticism upon the
standard of purification set forth in the report, or, in other words,
have you any criticism upon the result that is to be attained with
respect to purification of water mentioned in the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No criticism whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The municipalities you represent are entirely in accord
with the report, so far as it relates to standardization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You recognize the obligation of your community to
get rid of the sewage, but you want to do it as economically as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That is exactly the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You do not quarrel with the onus being thrown upon
you to do it in some way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No. All these villages seem to be very willing to do
something, and they are anxious. They know of this investigation,
and they have delayed works on that account, and they are very anxious
to do the best possible good for all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Your present population is 15,000?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That is the population they gave for River Rouge,
but I think it is not as large as that. I think you will find the present
population is only about half of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there anyone here representing any of the other
municipalities on the United States side?</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF ALEXANDER ADAMS,<br>OF ECORSE, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I am here representing Ecorse, and the council there
met and said they were in accord with the arrangement. They wanted
some system of treating the sewage, but nothing has been done at all.
The water supply there is furnished by the Detroit water board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The council has taken action in the matter, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No; they have not taken action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have they taken any action in approving or disapproving
of the report of our sanitary engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. They approve of the idea set forth in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. With respect to the treatment of sewage and the
purification of the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Then is Mr. Murdock here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I represent Mr. Murdock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there anything further? Do you occupy any official
position in the village?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. None at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any information as to whether or not the
council contemplate, in the near future, proceeding with work which
they recognized as being necessary for the purpose of purifying the
sewage, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. They have not yet. They have proposed to put in
some extensions to the present system, but not purifying it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You understand that they anticipate looking for
certain results in the way of improvement in the treatment of the
sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You are to be congratulated, because you recognize
the obligation and propose to face it like men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes; it is our opinion something should be done, and
we want it to be the best arrangement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Anyone here representing Trenton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. Yes. I would like to take it up this afternoon.
I have thought of some notes I would like to jot down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Jennings is here, representing the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Clair. What is your official position, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. Mayor of the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. MAX JENNINGS,<br>OF <abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> CLAIR, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. I am mayor of the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you or your sanitary engineers received the
report of our consulting engineers with respect to remedying the pollution
of these waters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. We have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any suggestions or criticisms?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Or any statement you would wish to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. I was in hopes we would have the engineer with us
to-day. He is not here. I presume he will be here this afternoon.
It has been placed in his hands, and he assured me he would be here
to present his views this afternoon. The superintendent of the electric
light and waterworks understands the situation better than I
do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have had the report studied by your engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. It has been placed in the hands of Mr. C. L. Weil;
he is not our engineer, but is the consulting engineer of the Diamond
Crystal Salt Works, and it may be he will be here right after lunch.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. WILLIAM WOLLATT,<br>OF WALKERVILLE,
ONTARIO.</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Wollatt, you represent Walkerville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. In connection with the Essex Board of Utilities
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is for Essex County?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. For the municipalities in Essex County, opposite
Detroit, beginning with Ford, Walkerville, Windsor, Sandwich,
Sandwich West, and Ojibway. That is running down the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. The extreme distance between the two points is
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Probably about 12 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you full jurisdiction over the whole territory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. This bill which I have in my hand gives the commission
complete jurisdiction. This is an act passed by the Ontario
Legislature last session. We just simply wish to report that this act
has been granted to the utilities commission, and we are getting busy.
We have a meeting this week, at which action will be taken as to
what the outcome will be of the matters under discussion. We are in
deep sympathy with the water question and the sewage matter; but
just what the utilities commission will do we can not say at the
present moment. We are not that far advanced yet, except to say, of
course, that we will have to be governed by the provincial board of
health.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are subject to the Ontario or Provincial Board
of Health?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you given any study, or have your engineers
given any study, to the report of the sanitary engineers of this
commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. No; not yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Have you organized yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Just last week, so far as the appointment of a chairman
and secretary; but no further organization. We will do that
this week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What are your purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. The bill sets out that we may construct main waterworks,
which will be a system taking in from Ford to Ojibway and
sewers in similar manner, if they are thought desirable. Whether
it will be done under this or individually the commission have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
got that far yet. We are in a preliminary stage in regard to that yet.
We thought we would come here and let you gentlemen know we are
alive to this situation, and that we have taken action in having this
bill passed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Your utility commission exists purely for water
problems?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Water and sewage. We are hoping to include other
matters later, such as town planning, and so on. That will come later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is your commission already named?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes; and the commission has been appointed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is the commission appointed named in the bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. The municipalities are named in the bill, with
power in the municipality to name their commissioners, the mayors
being ex officio members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you copies of that bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. No. I can let you have this, and we can probably
secure more for you, if necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. The commission has been formed already and constituted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. And proposes to consider these problems?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. And that is the position you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. That is our position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You have doubtless received the report of our
sanitary engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Have you any remarks to make with respect to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. No: I must confess that I have not, because I have
not studied the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Who are the officers of the commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Myself, as chairman—William Wollatt—and J. E.
Hoan, Walkerville, secretary. We have no further officers appointed
yet, although this bill empowers us to engage engineers and various
other officers as we may find necessary as we proceed. The municipalities,
we may say, have all consented; that is, the municipalities
named and included in this for the commission to take the matter
of sewer and water out of their hands and place it in the hands of
the commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What led to the obtaining of that commission?
Was it dissatisfaction with the present conditions over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Not altogether. We had in view a very large
growth on that side of the border, and we were not as well provided
with water as we thought we ought to be, and that was one of the
main things; then the unsatisfactory conditions entered into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I suppose economic considerations entered into it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes; that entered into it partly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Are you prepared to indorse the results of the examination
and the recommendation by our sanitary experts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. That is a question I would hardly like to answer
at this time without having the proper consultation with the engineer
who may be appointed to go into the matter in detail. We are
heartily in sympathy with the proposition to obtain pure water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
That is what we want, but just how we shall obtain such we can not
at this moment say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. But you realize that you must live up to the treaty
conditions; that you must not pollute water to the injury of health
or property on this side of the boundary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes; and we presume they will not do anything on
this side to injure us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you copies of the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. I believe we have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. One has been sent to all the villages, and I did not
know whether your board had one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wollatt</span>. Yes; we have one.</p>

<p>(Adjourned till 2.30 p. m.)</p>


<p class="p2 center">AFTER RECESS.</p>

<p>The commission reconvened at the expiration of the recess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Jennings, we will hear you now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. Gentlemen, I am not prepared to say very much on
this preliminary report that has been made, the engineering part of
it being out of my line, but I will say for the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair that
we indorse this project in principle, although perhaps the engineering
points of it we might not agree with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You mean that your city indorses the results of the
investigations so far as they relate to the treatment of sewage and
the purification of water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. Yes, sir; we are heartily in sympathy with the
purification of water. We think it is necessary and we certainly shall
do all we can to push the project along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any criticism to make in respect to the
standards proposed for the treatment of the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. Nothing that I know of. The preliminary plans
as drawn up by your engineer I will leave for <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Weil, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Clair, to discuss with you. He is the consulting engineer of the
Diamond Crystal Salt <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, and a man who is well up in his line.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF <abbr title="Professor">PROF.</abbr> CHARLES LEWIS WEIL,<br>OF <abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> CLAIR, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Mr. Chairman, Mayor Jennings asked me to look over
the plans and the report of the consulting engineer of the commission,
which I have done. I am not here to report upon these plans
from the standpoint of an engineer, but I am here simply as one
having some interest in what should be done. What I have to say
could hardly be construed as other than the impressions of one who
has read the report and looked over the plans and is interested in the
outcome. In fact, until Mr. Gardner made some statements to me
here to-day I did not know just what the object of this meeting was.
I understood that we were here to be instructed and not to make comments.
So that, as I am trying to emphasize, what I have to say
will be rather in the way of my impressions than carefully thought
out criticisms or considerations.</p>

<p>As Mayor Jennings has said, I was impressed with the report in
its entirety and not only as it relates to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair but, seeing it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the first time yesterday, I admit that I read pretty nearly the whole
report.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the fact that the plan proposed for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair
divides the city into two sections, with the point of purification as
a division, and that might be objectionable from a real estate standpoint.
It may not be practicable to do otherwise, but that is what they
have done at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair. Sewage disposal should be at the outskirts
and not in the center of the city.</p>

<p>Again, I was impressed with the fact that the Diamond Crystal
Salt <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, which is the chief industry located at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair, is at the
proposed point of purification and disposal. That might constitute
a hardship for the leading industry of the town. The Diamond
Crystal Salt <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> has recently expended a great deal of money for a
new intake pipe 24 inches in diameter and 350 feet long. It has
recently expended a large sum of money for a filtration system to
filter all the water that goes into the plant, to the salt beds, and
through its vessels. It is expending a large sum of money for sterilizing
the brine and carrying it to a temperature of 280° F. before it is
used.</p>

<p>It may be known to this commission that experiments made in
France show that pathogenic germs live for six months in brine
not subjected to a temperature of 100° C. The department in France
that made the experiments corresponds to our bureau in the United
States having to do with pure foods and drugs. In France they
were even going so far as to prohibit the sale of so-called natural
salt, sea salt, and so forth, for the table, on the basis of impurity. The
ordinary vacuum plant, as you may know, carries a temperature of
only about 120° F., and that does not destroy pathogenic germs in
brine.</p>

<p>As I have stated, the Diamond Crystal Salt <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> has gone to a very
large expense to produce pure salt. The location of a plant of the
kind mentioned at that point, notwithstanding the amount of proof
that could be brought to bear to show that harmful results would be
a minimum, might possibly be very objectionable. I can say that,
in my individual opinion, and not speaking for the company, I feel
that the company would be willing to cooperate with the city of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair to secure a location that would be more advantageous to
this plant. I am not criticizing the proposition, but simply stating
that the proposed location may be objectionable, and I may be wrong
with regard to that.</p>

<p>Another impression that I got from the report was this: I found
that it says that the population of this city has not increased in 25
years. I think that is about right. I also found in looking over the
report that they would pay over 2 to 1 to maintain this plant
if it were put in as proposed; that is, the cost of maintenance would
be, roughly speaking, 2 to 1: say, 50 cents perhaps in Detroit
and 90 cents in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair, something like twice the expense on a city
that is in no way an increased menace if it has not changed its conditions
at all. Therefore it would appear to me as a taxpayer and
one interested from the outside that the installation of such a plant
at the undivided expense of a small city like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair might perhaps
be a burden, and hardly a just burden, on the taxpayers when this
is, in a measure, an international matter. I understand from Mr.
Barron that the city would be subject to a considerable expense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
through its change in pavements if the plan at present proposed is
carried out.</p>

<p>The summation of what I have had to say is probably this: That
interested in the improvement of and desirous to combine in this
plan, a small city like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair has to be very guarded in its commendation
or acceptance on account of the conditions that might be
imposed through a too hasty conclusion in the matter. I think that is
about all I have to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the population of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Three thousand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You probably observed in reading the report of the
consulting sanitary engineer that three possible sites for the treatment
plant were studied, and I understand that the one that is recommended
here is the one that you are objecting to.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you considered the objection stated by the
engineers to either of the other two?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes; as I recall, I have. I think it was simply a matter
of expense. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes. One of them was abandoned without detailed
study, because it obviously required an unduly expensive intercepting
line. Another site located on the west side of Pine River was studied
in detail, but was found to require a more expensive system of interceptors
than the one east of Pine River, which is shown on plate No.
16, and that is the plan that I understand you object to.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. May I ask the commission a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Is it good engineering to reject the most expensive site
on the ground of expense when it is an international matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I did not quite catch your question.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Would the commission consider it good engineering
to reject a certain site on the ground of expense when it is an international
matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It would be if an equally available site could be obtained
for a less expense.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Is this not a third selection, this last one that was
selected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes; it was selected in preference to the other two.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. On the grounds of expense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. That means, then, that the expense is to fall on the
municipality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. No; the selecting of the third site, as I understand it,
was to save expense to the municipality.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. But that means that the expense must fall on the
municipality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. In a big question of sanitation like this, should the
matter of expense be the question of a municipality that is not
growing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Here is the situation: These waters into which you
are discharging your raw sewage are international waters. The result
is the contamination or pollution of these waters, which, whether
it does now or not, may in the future result in a violation of the treaty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
between the United States and Great Britain. The two Governments,
which have agreed that neither will permit on their respective sides
the pollution of these waters to the injury or health or property on
the other, have a right to put a stop to it by requiring the municipalities
which are thus offending against the treaty to either treat their
sewage or discharge it elsewhere than in these international waters.</p>

<p>Now, the purpose is to find the most practicable and economical
method for the treatment of the sewage by these cities that are
using these international waters as open sewers. We are engaged
in an effort to carry out the provisions of the treaty, or to advise the
two Governments how the provisions of the treaty may be carried
out with the least possible expense to the municipalities that are using
these waters as open sewers for the purpose of disposing of their
raw sewage, and the only methods that our consulting sanitary engineers
have been able to devise and recommend are those which are
proposed here.</p>

<p>I did not quite get your objection to the third site suggested by
the consulting engineer—I mean the site east of Pine River, which is
indicated on plate No. 16.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. I made two objections to it, one the location with regard
to the main manufacturing industry of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How would it affect this salt industry?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. I have tried to explain how it might affect it. I think
you will appreciate that all I have said is tentative. I have explained
that the company has gone to a very large expense to do what, in so
far as I know, no other salt company in the world is doing—filter
all the water that goes into the beds and into its plant and sterilize
the brine. Now, the location of this plant in the immediate vicinity
of the salt works might have a very bad effect, so far as impression is
concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Sentimental?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Not at all; but actual physiological and psychological
effect.</p>

<p>Another point I tried to bring out was that it divided the town
into two districts, when in my opinion it would be to the advantage
of the town to have this proposed plant for purifying located on the
outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>There is one question that I would like to ask now: Is it likely to be
the recommendation of the commission in furtherance of what you
have cited in regard to the treaty that these things shall be carried
out even if they constitute a hardship on the particular ownership,
municipality, or village?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That depends altogether upon whether the sewage
which they are discharging crosses the boundary and constitutes
what the treaty describes as an injury to health or property on the
other side. If it does, it would have to be prevented, or else the
treaty obligations between the two nations would be violated. Of
course, if the water beyond the boundary is not polluted at all by
reason of the discharge of raw sewage on either side, then the discharge
of that sewage would not be in contravention of the treaty; but
if it crosses the boundary into another country to the injury of the
health or property of the people of that country, it would have to
stop or the two Governments would have to rescind or enforce their
treaty obligations. It would be a question of fact as to whether or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
not the pollution extends across the boundary to the injury of the
health and property of the people on the other side. If it does it
would have to be stopped, no matter what expense might be imposed
on the people who are offending against this provision of the treaty.
That is my interpretation of the provisions of the treaty, and I think
it is the interpretation of the members of the commission generally.</p>

<p>You can readily understand and appreciate the position that this
commission is in. We are created an international tribunal for the
purpose of carrying out the provisions of a treaty which has been
entered into by two great countries. There will be no hardship
imposed upon any community if that community is not offending
against the provisions of the treaty. If the people of any community
are offending against the provisions of the treaty, they will
have to take some means of preventing that which constitutes a
violation of the treaty. I do not say that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair is doing that, but
if the conclusion of the commission should be that that is a fact
with respect to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair, it would have to adopt some method for
the treatment of its sewage.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Then, what is the object of this meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. To ascertain what objections the various communities
have to the plans proposed by the consulting engineer for the treatment
of the sewage, so as to avoid any violation of this treaty.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. If I understand your last remarks, it is perfectly immaterial
what objections we may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. No; if the communities have any better method
than the one proposed, one that would be less expensive and equally
as efficient, the commission would be very glad to hear of it. This
is simply a report to the commission by the consulting sanitary
engineer employed by the commission for that purpose. The commission
has not formulated its conclusions, and before formulating
them it desires to hear from the various communities affected by the
recommendations of our consulting sanitary engineer.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Of course, you understand that what I have said has
been in the way of interrogation rather than criticism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Well, we are endeavoring to answer your interrogations
to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. We would like to hear any criticism that you think
proper to make as to the methods suggested by the consulting engineer.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. In a general way I have already stated what the objections
are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. The objection that you have stated is one relating
to the location. Is there any objection with respect to the burden
that this proposed plan would entail upon the community?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. The burden is fixed here, an actual charge per
capita.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. What is it for Detroit?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. It is 54 cents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Then, it is nearly twice as much for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair as for
Detroit. I do not think that is fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is the necessary result of doing things on a
larger scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. On our plan there for interceptors I notice that
they are running down Riverside Avenue. It might be a question
for your engineer to consider, whether it would not be possible to
place these interceptors one street farther back from the river. Riverside
Avenue is a paved street. It is a concrete pavement, and perhaps
the expense of digging that up and repaving it would be more
than it would cost to take a street farther back from the river.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. That is absolutely immaterial to us, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jennings</span>. They can be placed anywhere?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Anywhere that you please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Weil, I suppose you and the community in
which you live recognize the necessity of doing something to prevent
this evil?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. I think you will find I stated at the outset that we
recognize that very fully and are anxious to cooperate in its prevention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You recognize that something should be done to
prevent the raw sewage from going into the river?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. All that you are aiming at is to have it done as inexpensively
as possible?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes; and not arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is no desire to take anybody by the throat; this
is a friendly consultation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. I understand that, but we would like know what is
going to be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. To the general scheme proposed by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps you
have no objection; your objections apply only to the details of working
it out?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. As to the general scheme for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Do you mean the use of the interceptors, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. That is so very general that I could hardly have any
objection to it. There is nothing different in that from what has
been done for years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It is only the details of working out the scheme to
which you object?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And those objections you have spoken of?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Weil</span>. Yes; I have tried to cover them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Knowles, we will hear you now, as representing
the Great Lakes Pure Water Association.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. MORRIS KNOWLES,<br>OF PITTSBURGH, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">PA.</abbr>,<br>
REPRESENTING THE GREAT LAKES PURE WATER ASSOCIATION.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. As I stated this morning, there is another representative
of the Great Lakes Pure Water Association, Mr. Theodore
M. Leison, who will speak for that organization. He could not be
here this afternoon, but will be present to-morrow morning. You
may consider that he will be the official representative of and will
speak for the association.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>While I am on my feet, and speaking entirely personally, I would
say that I was very much gratified to hear the remarks of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Phelps that the suggestions in the report should be considered as such
and not necessarily as determinative plans, because it seems to me
that, above all, the initiative should be left to the communities to
work out their own salvation as long as that may result accordingly
in a general, well-defined policy; I think it is helpful to us as engineers
to realize that as coming from your engineer, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps.
It seems to me that this policy is a well-considered one, so that all
of us who are interested in sanitation ought to work toward the
fruition of such a plan. It is necessary that separate places shall have
separate solutions dependent upon topographical conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Knowles, you have had sufficient time and opportunity,
have you not, to give some study to the report of our consulting
engineers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. I think I may have had sufficient time, but I do
not know that I have given it sufficient study, because I have many
other things to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. From the time you have given to the study of the
report have you any criticism or suggestion to make as to the result,
especially with respect to the standards of purification which have
been recommended by our consulting engineers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. As long as they can be considered generally and
subject to consideration for each particular locality by a continuing
body, no; but if they should be made once for all determinative, I
would think that would be an error, because the art is changing so
fast that such a position ought not to be taken by any body of men
at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Let me understand you. You mean, do you, that
there should be sufficient flexibility in the standard fixed to enable
a continuing administrative body charged with the duty of supervising
the execution of the recommendations to make such changes
as are necessary to suit local conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. And changes in the art as time goes on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Changes in the art of treatment; that is what you
mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. Yes, sir; changes in the art both of treatment of
sewage and the purification of the water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Then, from your studies of the proposition do I
understand you to suggest that the most efficient and satisfactory
results would be obtained by the creation of an international administrative
body for the purpose of looking after the purification
of water and treatment of sewage along these international boundary
waters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. I have not studied the machinery of legislation
closely enough to express an opinion upon that final thing. I do
believe that no effective progress can be made without some continuing
body being on the job all the time. I presume it goes without
saying that this being an international question it shall finally rest
in some international body. I, however, couple that with the thought
that the initiative should not only rest with the given municipality,
but probably a still further initiative with the governing body representing
that Province, that State, or that Government; the final
question being left to the international body to determine the larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
questions of policy. The way to get good work is to put responsibility
for detail upon the person who carries it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is good policy in all government, political or
otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. While we all recognize that sanitary science is in a
condition of change or progress, yet we can not sit still and do nothing.
We must live up to the light that we have for the time being.
So that we could not lie by and do nothing simply because there is a
possibility of other methods being invented or coming to light within
a certain period of time in the future. We have to do what is
best at the present moment under the present light. You understand
that condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. If you ask that as a question, I would say, yes,
that is true. It is neither necessary to stand still nor to fix a criterion
that is good forever. The way in which those things are
handled by the departments of health in the States, and I presume
in Dr. McCullough’s department, is that a given project is acted
upon at a given time with the light that the people then have, but
frequently there are clauses which say that if at any time it appears
that the works are not adequate, or something else is required, the
right is reserved to the governing body to stipulate further requirements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is, you do not want the process of evolution
to cease?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. No, sir. The important thing to consider is that
this is not the only measure of public health which is before the
people at this time. There are many other things upon which public
money can be spent, and it is the measure of this thing with the
other things to help public health that should be considered in any
large questions of policy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Knowles, are you prepared to give the commission
any information regarding the treatment of sewage by aeration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Do you think we are proceeding along the right
lines in making these engineering suggestions as to these interceptor
sewers? Do you think that those suggestions will be in line
with any future development?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. Well, the relative advantages of long interceptors
compared with small unit plants is all a question of finance coupled
with some question of real estate development policy, but, of course,
with any large body of water directly in front of a long community
the place to which the sewage must go is that body of water. The
most direct means is generally the most economical means, and the
measure of cost of a number of plants compared with the cost of an
interceptor is what is needed to find out whether the interceptor is
advisable or not. No one can say what is most acceptable in either
case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is your position, Mr. Knowles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. I am a consulting sanitary engineer in general practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Located where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. In Pittsburgh, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> That is my home now. I have
practiced over the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are you connected officially with the Great Lakes
Pure Water Association?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. Yes, sir; I am a member of that association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. From your knowledge of the reference submitted
to the commission by the two Governments and your knowledge of
the scope of the investigation, what have you to say with reference
to whether or not thus far the investigation has proceeded practically
and as speedily as would ordinarily be expected under the circumstances?
I am asking you the same question that Mr. Magrath asked
this morning of the chief sanitary engineer of the State of Michigan,
merely for the purpose of getting on the record an expression of your
views.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. I think good progress and good judgment up to date
have been shown, provided the criteria be taken as not too absolute;
and the statement made by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps this morning is very helpful
along that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any knowledge as to the time that was
consumed in the investigation of a similar subject in the Mississippi
River on account of the alleged pollution of that river by the Chicago
Drainage Canal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. No; I do not know the exact time. It was some
considerable time. I think it must be remembered that in any of
these matters it not only takes time for an investigation, but it takes
a good deal of time for necessary assimilation and education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes; and time thus spent is well spent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Knowles</span>. It is not lost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We will now hear what Mr. Sloman, a member of
the bar of the city of Detroit, desires to say on this subject.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. ADOLPH SLOMAN,<br>OF DETROIT, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Prefacing what I have to say, I desire to state that
I was born and brought up in the city of Detroit. I have practiced
law during the past 37 years. I have had a summer home during
the past 18 years at what is called Sans Souci on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair River
about midway between Detroit and Port Huron.</p>

<p>Some little time before your commission was appointed, on an
occasion when my eldest daughter was down in the city and there
was apparently an epidemic of typhoid she contracted typhoid fever,
and we came near losing her. It was that which caused me to
interest myself very much in this question of the water supply and its
pollution.</p>

<p>Our summer home has a frontage of about 1,400 feet on the river,
on the south channel, where all the boats pass. Only as recently as
two weeks ago last Saturday there came down the river a quantity
of oil in the form of scum that covered the river from the center
clear to the shore. An east wind that was prevailing at the time
blew that stuff over to the shore, and the launches and rowboats stationed
at the dock were covered with that oil clear to the gunwales.
It was almost a day before we could get a drop of drinking water
from the river. It was that situation that I called to the attention
of the minister of fisheries, to which the letter that I have here is a
reply. The oil supply supposedly came from the Imperial Oil <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
at Sarnia. The quantity was simply enormous. It came down in
spots, covering an area of over 40 feet square. It looked like filth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Was it black?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. No; it was a dark brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Was it raw oil as it comes from the earth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Evidently so. Underneath that, of course, the marks
of the oil were apparently in the usual form in which it is found
floating on the water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has that condition happened only once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. No; it has happened before, but not to the extent
that it did at the time I refer to. No one who has lived up there
and has seen conditions and is at all familiar with fishing can help
but realize that another happening of that kind will interfere
seriously with fishing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You had better read that letter that you received
from the minister of fisheries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. This letter comes from the deputy minister of the
naval service. When this condition presented itself I at once got in
touch with the United States Engineer office in the expectation that
some one on the American side who had the power would take some
steps to prevent its recurrence. Upon calling up the Engineer office
I found that <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Patrick was about to start for the Mexican border,
and he could not give it any attention. He was fearful that the
matter might not receive proper attention from his office, and it was
not strictly in his line. Inasmuch as the stuff had apparently come
from the Canadian side, I got in touch with the minister of fisheries,
because I understood that on a former occasion they had gone after
this oil company. It is not an uncommon occurrence to find oil in
large quantities coming down the river there. Over in Mitchells
Bay large quantities of carp have died as the result of an accumulation
of that stuff that has floated or drifted over there on account of
the wind. In reply to my communication I received the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
<span class="smcap">Ottawa</span>, <i>June 22, 1916</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have your letter of the 19th instant with regard to the pollution of
the Michigan side of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair River by heavy deposits of oil, apparently
coming from a plant operating at Sarnia, Lambton County, Ontario.</p>

<p>Your representations will be referred to the department of game and fisheries,
Toronto, which administers the fishery regulations for Ontario, and immediate
attention will be requested in the matter. I am, sir,</p>

<p class="l2">Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap r4">G. J. Desbarats,</span><br>
<span class="r2"><i>Deputy Minister of the Naval Service</i>.</span><br>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Adolph Sloman</span>, Esq.,<br>
<span class="l2"><i>Counselor at Law, Suite 330, Penobscot Building, Detroit, <abbr title="Michigan">Mich.</abbr></i></span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">In trying to ascertain what was the real prolific cause of the fouling
of the water supply I tried to decide in my own mind in watching
the boats pass by to what extent they were responsible for the
contamination of the water supply. I wish you gentlemen could
have the privilege of standing with me on my dock some night to
see the condition of the water. You would raise your hands in holy
horror and say, Is it possible that this is the stuff which the people
are obliged to drink? The rays of light penetrate the water and
show the impurities in it. There are no words that can express the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
foul condition of that water, and we get our drinking water from
that source.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the relation of the boat traffic on the river
to this pollution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. With regard to the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. I believe that at least a quarter if not a third of the
foul matter that is deposited in the river comes from the vessels.
And I want to say to you that I have never been able to understand
how the rights of human life ought to be set to one side for the
rights of property, what earthly justification there is for allowing
these vessels to deposit their foul matter in the river when they could
take care of it by incinerating plants. They may say it would put
them to some inconvenience. What of it? I think we have a right
to have health considered first. Not only that, but take the condition
that existed 25 years ago. The water of the Detroit River was
considered the finest in the world for drinking purposes. The city
was comparatively small as considered to its population of to-day;
the tonnage was small as compared with what it is to-day; but with
the increase of this tonnage and the increase of population, together
with the fact that vessels have been built in the past few years of
heavy draft, it has been utterly impossible for nature to take care
of what it would ordinarily take care of in the matter of pollution.</p>

<p>It is usually said that water purifies itself every 7 miles. These
vessels coming along there churn that water up above the intake
pipe and the northeast winds blow that stuff over. Those boats with
big drafts churn up that stuff all the way up to the ship canal, and
with the wind blowing from the northeast, it riles over the city
supply intake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Where is your property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. At Sans Souci, which is on Harrisons Island, about
3 miles southeast of Algonac, on the south channel of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair
River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How far from Sarnia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. It is about midway between Detroit and Sarnia, and
Sarnia is directly opposite Port Huron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Then, it would be about halfway between Sarnia
or Port Huron and Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Of course, the pollution which you mentioned
comes from above.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. It comes from above. At Algonac the oil apparently
does not go down the north channel, but goes down the south channel.
When an east wind is blowing it can be plainly seen on the shore.
For a week no woman could attempt to step on that shore without
ruining her dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Did I understand you to say that your property is
on an island?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. It is on Harrisons Island; directly opposite is Squirrel
Island, and directly opposite that is Warpool Island.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Your property is on the American side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. It is on the American side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Did you make any inquiries as to how the Imperial
Oil Co. allowed this stuff to escape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. No; I did not get up there. It has not been my privilege
to get up there since this occurrence, but I at once got in touch
with the authorities that I thought would handle that situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It may have been due to carelessness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. It looked as though they had let go what might be
considered a tremendous quantity of oil. No ordinary quantity could
have made a showing such as that did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How often has it happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. In different forms it has been going on for four or
five years. It has come down two dozen times—not in that quantity,
but the water would show traces of oil below the surface and on the
surface.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Do you mean that it has happened two dozen times
in a year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. No; during that period of the past four or five years.
But it is not only that; when an east wind blows we get on our shore
the garbage and foul matter that comes from the vessels. This year
it is particularly hard on us because there never were so many vessels
going up and down the river as there are to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How long ago since this happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Two weeks ago last Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Coming up the bay this morning, at this end of the
Livingstone Channel, just about the Limekiln Reef, there was a lot
of stuff on the surface that looked like raw sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Well, there probably was; but the Limekiln crosses
below the city of Detroit, while this was above.</p>

<p>Just a thing or two more I would like to say in that connection.
As I say, I was born and brought up here in the city of Detroit, and
I will give way to no one in the matter of loyalty to the city of my
birth, but Detroit is confronted with a problem that she must absolutely
take care of, no matter what the cost is. It is merely a question
of time when the water supply will be absolutely unfit for drinking
purposes. We are drinking to-day chlorinated water. It was
only a matter of a year or two ago when they cleaned out the reservoir
of the waterworks, and I would hate to tell you what they found.
There were two skeletons among the objects found there and a lot of
very foul matter. The middle and wealthier classes are not drinking
Detroit water; they are drinking well water, simply because if they
use Detroit water they must drink this chlorinated water. The question
is whether Detroit ought not to build in the future so as to conserve
life rather than property or expense.</p>

<p>The city of Grand Rapids was confronted with a similar condition
in 1913. Grand Rapids is a city of about 115,000 inhabitants. They
undertook to discharge their sewage into the Grand River, and one
of the towns below there filed a bill in the State court for an injunction
to restrain the city from letting its sewage go into the river. I
would like to call your attention to that case because it is full of
facts; it is full of the testimony of the engineers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The plaintiff’s appeal succeeded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Yes; the injunction was granted, and the city of
Grand Rapids was given one year in which to take care of that
sewage matter. When it comes to the question of what Detroit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
should do in the way of purifying its waters, I am not prepared to
give any technical information—that is for the engineers—but I do
wish to say to you that if you will examine this case you will find
testimony of some of the ablest engineers in the State of Michigan
as to what ought to be done. If I may be permitted, I would like to
call attention to some features of that case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Give the full citation of the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. The case is reported in One hundred and seventy-fifth
Michigan, page 503. The title is Attorney General ex rel.,
Township of Wyoming <i>v.</i> City of Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That suit was brought on behalf of the Commonwealth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. It was brought on behalf of the village of Grandville,
which felt the effects of the foul matter that was being deposited
in the river. The court in that case said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a proceeding by information in the nature of a bill in equity filed
in the name of the attorney general upon the relation of the township of
Wyoming, through its township board, its board of health, and its supervisor,
and upon the relation of the village of Grandville in said township and certain
riparian owners upon Grand River in said township against the city of
Grand Rapids, its common council, its board of public works, and board of
health, to declare and to abate and restrain the continuance of an alleged
public nuisance. The nuisance is claimed to result from acts of the city of
Grand Rapids in conveying through artificial means its sewage into the Grand
River, which flows down the river and is cast upon the land below that city,
and particularly upon those lands which are adjacent to and within the village
of Grandville, and there created a public nuisance. It is also claimed that the
emptying of sewage into the river so pollutes its waters as to constitute a
nuisance in the waters themselves by reason of the odors therefrom and the
contamination therefrom.</p>

<p>The city of Grand Rapids is located upon both sides of Grand River: its
population in April, 1909, when the bill was filed, was upward of 110,000;
its sewage is carried into the Grand River through sewers, which aggregate
upward of 171 miles in length, without purification of any character. In
addition to this the night soil from the outlying houses which have no sewer
connection is collected in barrels and dumped into the Present Street sewer,
and flows into the river. The township of Wyoming is located south of the
city of Grand Rapids; the river, after passing through the city, flows southerly
and westerly between the townships of Wyoming and Walker. On the south
bank of the river, at a point where it turns abruptly to the west, and about
7 miles below the city of Grand Rapids, is located the village of Grandville,
with about 750 inhabitants. Considerable area in Grandville is low; there is
a ridge of high ground along the river bank, which is 5 or 6 feet higher than
the low ground behind it.</p>

<p>It appears that the river overflows its banks once or twice a year; at these
times of overflow a large area in Grandville is flooded, and the river becomes
very much wider than it is ordinarily and the current increases rapidly. As
the river goes down and after the water ceases to flow back into the river a
pond of about 20 acres is left in the edge of the village, the escape of the water
back into the river by flowage being prevented by the higher ground next to
the river. The water left in this pond is from 4 to 6 feet deep, and gradually
disappears through evaporation and seepage into the soil.</p>

<p>It is the claim of the complainants that the emptying of the large amount of
sewage produced in Grand Rapids into the river contaminates its waters and
fills them with impurities which are carried down the stream as it flows to,
and into, or through the village; that, as the water goes down, the substances
and impurities which are in it, due to the sewage, whether visible or invisible,
are left upon the surface of the ground, and there decomposition creates such
odors as to constitute a public nuisance in the village. The most of the houses
in Grandville surround the flooded area, and there are four houses and eight
privies within the area covered by water in ordinary flood. There are many
more houses and privies covered by the highest water known in Grandville.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Now, you have identically the same situation here that they had.
You have the towns below us here of Wyandotte, Trenton, and others
that abut on the Detroit River. They occupy the same position with
regard to the city of Detroit as did this town of Grandville with
regard to the city of Grand Rapids, and, inasmuch as the city of
Detroit sooner or later is going to be confronted with the question of
whether or not they must take care of the sewage as between those
towns and it, just so the question might as well be disposed of by
Federal legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. In the absence of any special statutes on the part of
your State, your common laws are precisely the same as the Canadian
common law of Ontario, and the principle is very clear. I do not
think there is any necessity of citing any authority on it. Every
lower party is entitled to have the water flow to him in its crystal
purity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. There is no denying that proposition. This case
is only interesting, gentlemen, with reference to the fact that it
involves the inquiry as to what could or might be done to overcome
the difficulty. In that respect it applies here very strongly. That
is why I read portions of this authority at this time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bill of complaint, among other things, states that the system of sewers
in the city of Grand Rapids does not cover the entire city, there being about
one-quarter of the inhabitants of said city who do not discharge their refuse,
of the character ordinarily discharged into and carried away by sewers, into
the sewers of the city, but who discharge and deposit their filthy and unhealthy
refuse into vaults and cesspools; that in the past such refuse, night soil, and
unhealthy substances have been, and were at the time of filing the bill, collected
by scavengers for said city and carried into the country, outside of said city,
where the same was buried in deep beds, without creating any nuisance and
without injury to the health of the surrounding neighbors; that there was, at
the time of the filing of the bill, under contemplation by the said city of Grand
Rapids, and its said authorities had recommended and intended and threatened
to put into operation, a plan whereby the said refuse and night soil, then collected
by its scavengers, would be carried to and emptied into the said Prescott
Street sewer in said city; that the authorities had voted and determined to dispose
this refuse and night soil, and they were about to commence the emptying
of said sewage and night soil into the said sewer and were at the time taking
steps, or about to take steps, through the expenditure of public money, for
the emptying of said refuse and night soil into the said sewer.</p>

<p>The bill states that the night soil so collected amounted at that time to
from 150 to 180 barrels a day, and if emptied into the said sewer would be
carried into the Grand River and would greatly add to the pollution and contamination
of its waters, and that the same would create a public nuisance in
the rendering of the waters of said river injurious to users thereof; and by
the overflows of said river and through deposits along the banks thereof of
deleterious, unhealthful, and noxious substances and through the creation of
noisome and unhealthful odors arising from the waters of said river so contaminated
an additional public nuisance would be created; that the township
board of health of the township of Wyoming had taken action in the matter, in
accordance with the statute, and had published this action, in which it protested
against the emptying of sewage and night soil into said sewer, as contemplated
by the city, and had declared the same to be a nuisance and a
source of filth and cause of sickness in said township, and injurious to the
health of the people thereof. * * *</p>

<p>The bill further claims that the use of the waters of said Grand River by
the said city in the manner which was then contemplated would be improper,
unwarranted, and unlawful, and would constitute a daily menace to the lives,
health, and comfort of the persons residing along said river and in the township
of Wyoming and in the village of Grandville and would fill the air with
noisome and noxious odors and pollute the air in the neighborhood and render
it unfit to breathe; and that the said city could satisfactorily and economically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
dispose of its refuse matter, night soil, and sewage in any other manner or
through different methods than were then contemplated, without injury to
the health or lives of persons and without creating a public nuisance.</p>

<p>The bill prays that a permanent injunction be granted against the city of
Grand Rapids and its said boards, officers, and agencies, restraining and preventing
it, or them, from continuing to discharge the sewage which it then discharged
into Grand River and requiring it to abate the nuisance which it then
maintained in the pollution of the waters of said river. It also prayed that an
injunction issue restraining said city and its said officers and agencies from
carrying into effect their threatened and contemplated plan of emptying into
said sewer the refuse matter and night soil then being collected by the scavengers
of said city for the purpose of conveying the same into the Grand River,
and that they be restrained and prohibited from taking any action or in any
manner ordering the performance of any act on the part of any of its officers
or boards having the tendency to carry into effect the said threatened action,
which would result in said nuisance.</p>
</div>

<p>The court in this case enters very largely into a discussion of the
expert testimony that was given with regard to the relative situation
of the town, the amount of filth that was deposited in these waters,
the extent of the pollution, the size of the city, and the means and
ways whereby this pollution might be overcome. It gives the testimony
of the experts, and one of them I have particularly in mind
was a witness named George S. Pierson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The witness, George S. Pierson, called by the complainant, testified that he
was a civil engineer and had made a specialty of sanitary engineering for 25
or 30 years; that his work in a large measure required the supervision of plants
for water purification and installation of septic tanks; that he had supervised
sewage purification plants at Hermosa, Cal.; El Paso, Tex.; Marshalltown,
Iowa; Fond du Lac, Wis.; Jackson, Durand, Ithaca, Bay View, Charlevoix,
and Lake Cora, <abbr title="Michigan">Mich.</abbr>, and quite a number of smaller installations; that he
had visited most of the plants in operation in Massachusetts, including those in
Worcester, Amherst, Andover, Gardner, Framingham, Natick, Brockton, Lawrence,
and others; that those plants were in successful operation when he
visited them; that he had experience in estimating the cost of erection and
maintenance of such plants. The witness described modern methods of sewage
disposal, including septic tanks, and that the septic tank is almost universally
used in this country in the first and even in the final stage of the process; that
this accomplishes sufficient purification of the sewage so that it can be emptied
into a stream without damage or creating a nuisance; that the septic-tank
process is in successful operation in cities the size of Grand Rapids; that the
recent tendency had been to relieve streams from pollution by purifying the
sewage; that a sewage purification plant of a city the size of Grand Rapids is
feasible; that the cost of operation of a septic tank is nominal, only an occasional
cleaning, at periods varying from three months to six years; that the
water consumption of a city is an indication of the amount of its sewage, because
practically the entire water consumption finds its way into the sewers;
this may be increased by rains carrying with them the street washings; that
in providing a septic tank to ascertain its size we ascertain the daily total flow.</p>

<p>The witness further testified that he had made a general estimate which
would be sufficiently large to cover the cost of a sewage-disposal plant for
Grand Rapids, and he could positively say the cost would not exceed his estimate;
the approximate cost would be $1 per capita; for a city the size of Grand
Rapids it would be about $100,000; this is based upon separate septic tanks
without the cost of connecting the sewers; that the cost would not vary much
whether one or more tanks were used; that if a separate tank were installed
at each sewer outlet the cost would be slightly more, probably not more than
25 or 50 per cent; that there is a slight odor from a septic tank, not materially
different from the odor of any sewer discharge; if the tank discharges below
the water level the odor is masked; the septic tank alone reduces the amount
of organic matter in the sewage and the number of disease germs and brings
it into such condition that upon discharge it is rapidly purified; that the odor
would not last long after the discharge; it would be very much minimized from
the sewage being put into the water and the duration of the odor would be
less, and it would disappear within a very few hours; that in his judgment the
sewage of Grand Rapids in Grand River would not purify itself before it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
reached Grandville; that unless the stream has a very rapid flow there is immediate
sedimentation when sewage is discharged into a watercourse; that it
continues until a good part of the solids are lodged on the bottom of the stream;
that if there is a considerable sedimentation between Grand Rapids and Grandville
the effect of high water would be to dislodge it and carry it on; that the
pollution of the stream at that time would be much increased from what it
would be if the current did not take up this discharge; that the increased pollution
of the water caused by this would be apt to leave deposits at Grandville
that would increase the smells.</p>

<p>On cross-examination the witness testified that his statement as regards the
sediment on the bottom of the river was not based on actual tests in Grand
Rapids; that it depended to a considerable extent on the rapidity of the flow;
that material settling to the bottom of the stream would not cease to be contaminating
for quite a long time and would never become pure with additional
material from day to day; that he was not familiar with the river
between Grand Rapids and Grandville; that sewage odor from a stream within
clearly defined banks would not be particularly noticeable for a great distance,
it might for 5 miles, but would be reduced; that he had made no test
between Grand Rapids and Grandville to see what settled to the bottom of the
river; that his statement was general from what he supposed, and that he did
not know the velocity of the stream between the two points; that while there is
no great amount of purification in a sluggish stream in a distance of 6 or 7
miles, the faster a stream flows the farther the impurities are carried in a
given time; that it might be said it was the general rule in Michigan for
cities having sewer systems to carry the sewage into streams; that Grand
River at Jackson is smaller than at Grand Rapids, and that Jackson has the
largest municipal sewage-reduction plant that he knows of in this State; that
the sewage there is purified by filtration; that the largest plant he ever
established is at Auburn, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> (50,000 to 75,000 inhabitants); that Worcester,
Mass., with a population of 125,000 to 150,000, has such a tank; that the contaminating
influences of the sewage of the city the size of Grand Rapids
would not be as great if the sewage were not carried out into the river by
artificial means, as there would be purification of the organic matter by the
soil; and if it were not for the sewers there would be very little contaminating
influence upon the waters of the river.</p>
</div>

<p>And they then proceed to discuss the judgment of other experts,
who are referred to in the opinion. The opinion is somewhat at
length, and I do not care to take up the time of the commission
by reading it, but will be very glad to leave the book with you during
your visit, or you can take it along with you and return it
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What was the order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Requiring them to proceed to establish a septic
tank, and at a later time the court gave the city a year in which to
do it. That same situation presents itself with regard to Detroit.
Every one of these towns and cities abutting on the river are in
identically the same position as the city was when it filed the bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Why did the owners not file a bill before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. I think they were guilty of doing the very same
thing as the city of Detroit was. If you gentlemen had a large
farm and a lake upon it, and anybody filled it with excreta, you
would not drink the water, but we are drinking from a pond in
which millions, I might say, deposit their filth and excreta. I took
this matter up, when my daughter took ill, first with the city board
of health. Mr. Keefer was the health officer, and he attributed the
typhoid to the milk supply rather than the water, but was willing
to cooperate in any measure that would bring about a change in the
conditions that existed. I then took it up with the State board of
health, and finally with Washington, and shortly afterwards it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
found that there was an arrangement between Great Britain and the
United States for the appointment of an International Joint Commission,
and finally your body was appointed. I got in touch with
Chairman Tawney, giving him some data in regard to this matter,
and I had hoped to be present at the former meeting of the commission,
but was unavoidably called from the city, which made it
impossible for me to appear before you. Upon the land we take
care of our sewage through cesspools, which consist of practically
a large dry-goods box, made of 2-inch boards, rather than of the
thin material of which dry-goods boxes are made, inverted, with
the opening off, so that the opening is right under the soil and the
sewer pipes are connected with it. The soil is of a sandy, gravelly
character, which carries off the impurities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How deep are your cesspools?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. We can not go down below 4 feet before we strike
the water, but there are proprietors above me who run their sewers
into the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. All these sewers are private sewers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>With a view of getting the latest thought on the subject, I got in
communication with the health board at Lansing, and desire to
submit Bulletin No. 2 of the public health board of this State,
for the sewage disposal of single houses and small institutions, in
which they deal with the question of disposing of the sewage of the
schools where they have not sewer facilities. They also give a
diagram of a septic tank, by which it is claimed the solid matters
are taken up with the earth, while the water that comes out of the
septic tank is pure water. If it were possible to build septic tanks
for Detroit, whereby the excreta might be disposed of in the soil
and the pure water brought to the river, the danger would be
reduced to the minimum, but unless Detroit takes some active and
effective measure along that line we will be confronted in a short
time, especially with the tremendous increase in our population and
with the great increase in the industries, with an increased death
rate. It is merely a question of time when the death rate will be
appalling. I say that with a due sense of the responsibility I am
assuming and an appreciation of the facts. I have watched this
thing very carefully and studiously. One moment more on the
question of cost. The question of cost ought not to be taken into
consideration at all. You can not measure the loss of lives by cost,
and the city of Detroit can not afford to destroy the unique position
it occupies among the States of the Union by being backward in
the matter of taking care of its sewage and by losing such a water
supply as it had years ago, when it was the proud boast of the city
of Detroit, which to-day it is not. To-day it is a stench in the
nostrils of every community where they take the water from the
river passing by their doors. I sincerely hope the Federal Government
will take the matter in hand in such a way that it will not
be optional with the cities to determine whether or not they will
spend the money, but that measures will be passed providing means
for dealing with the waters on the Great Lakes, and that the engineers
will deal with the question in the best light; but foremost of
all, you must stop the boats from depositing excreta in the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and if you do not, no matter what you do, you can not take care of
this pollution. It is simply awful. Just think of the traffic running
up and down the river, and all that foul stuff and oil and grease
and dirty water deposited in front of your doors. We have the
boats passing in front of our doors every day, and when you stop
to think of it, it is an awful matter and Congress should not wait
a moment to take action on it. If you do not the upshot will be
you will kill every fish in the river; you can not help do it. If we
have a continuation of what has occurred during the past two or
three weeks, from my knowledge and experience as a fisherman who
has been going up along the river for the last 30 years, you will kill
every fish in the river, because the foulness gets to the bottom and
permeates that entire body of water, and nature, struggling as hard
as she will, can not possibly take care of it.</p>

<p>I just wish, as a lay citizen, only having the interests of my city
at heart, and feeling that the matter of life and health is of greater
concern than profit, to urge that you will in your report, as far as
it lies in your power, bring to the attention of Congress the really
awful condition that exists along our shores, and ask that some
measures be taken to remedy something which, if it is not remedied
soon, will result in a tremendous loss to the city, which you will be
sorry for in later days.</p>

<p>I thank you, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We will proceed now with the statements of those
who are here to speak for the lake traffic associations, and before
doing so we will hear <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps on the subject of pollution by
means of lake traffic.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. The progress report of the commission has sufficiently
placed on record the statement of the extent and distribution
by shipping interests. It will not be necessary for me to make
any further statement than to bring out two points of distinction
between this peculiar type of pollution and that with which we have
been dealing in the case of the cities. The first of these is due to the
movable character of this sort of pollution, whereby it may and does
pass within close proximity to the waterworks intake of the city.
The second of these is due to the fact that the steamboat traffic
is confined in lines, the result of which practice is the pollution of
the steamboat’s own water supply by steamboats which have preceded
it. The importance of this matter, which was emphasized in
the progress report, led us in the United States Public Health Service
to undertake a solution, a possible means of remedying the situation
which would satisfactorily dispose of these things without
undue expense or undue inconvenience to the city interests. These
investigations have been proceeding now for nearly two years, and
I am going to ask Mr. Leslie C. Frank, the sanitary engineer of the
United States Public Health Service, to describe to you the character
of the investigation and the type of apparatus which he has designed
to meet the situation, together with some remarks upon the
application of the apparatus at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. State what investigations the Government has made
and the results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF LESLIE C. FRANK,<br>
OF WASHINGTON, D. C., SANITARY<br>
ENGINEER,<br>UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. As <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps has told you, the Public Health
Service, realizing the probable future necessity of treating the
sewage from vessels in some way or another, has endeavored to
find a practicable solution. So that for the past two years we have
been studying various methods, and we have been experimenting
with what seemed to be the best method.</p>

<p>The method of traffic-sewage control is to provide storage tanks
for the sewage so equipped that the sewage is both automatically
disinfected and automatically discharged by means of steam or
other heating element when it has reached a certain predetermined
level in the tank. This method has been described in Reprint No.
247 of the Public Health Service reports. Briefly, the device consists
of a tank, as shown in the illustration, with a sewage influent
pipe penetrating nearly to the bottom; a discharge pipe having its
influent end near the bottom of the tank, and rising up through the
tank to a point above it; a float and valve with a lost-motion connection;
and a steam influent pipe. The operation of the tank is
simple. When the sewage has reached a certain predetermined level
the float automatically turns on the steam, which escapes into the
sewage through a number of small holes. All of the heat of the
steam, of course, is given up to the sewage, which rapidly approaches
the boiling point. As soon as the boiling point is reached, but not
before, pressure is developed in the tank and the sewage is forced
up and out through the discharge pipe. When, owing to this discharge,
the sewage level in the tank has dropped to a predetermined
minimum the float, through its lost-motion connection, turns off the
steam and the tank is ready for the next cycle of operation.</p>

<p>There are a number of distinct advantages of this method:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It depends upon heat for its disinfection efficiency, and heat
is generally acknowledged, as above noted, to be very thorough in
its action.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Its action is entirely automatic. This eliminates the uncertainties
of manual operation by a large number of employees.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If fresh sewage enters the device while it is being discharged,
the discharge immediately ceases.</p>

<p>There is no danger, therefore, of fresh sewage being carried out
untreated. This advantageous feature is due to the fact that as soon
as any fresh sewage enters the device its contents are chilled to a
temperature at which pressure is impossible. The new mixture must
again be brought to the boiling point before further discharge will
take place.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) It permits toilet doors to remain unlocked over drinking-water
areas.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) It permits toilet doors to remain unlocked while waiting in
stations. This latter has, of course, no public-health significance,
but it does concern very nearly the comfort of the passengers. In
lieu of locking the toilet doors while standing in stations, the porter
has merely to turn off a steam valve penetrating the car floor external
to the toilet. The tank can be designed with a sufficient reserve capacity
to care for any reasonable period of waiting. The objection
will be raised immediately, of course, that the porter may forget to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
turn on the valve when the train leaves the station. This is true,
but forgetfulness of this sort will rapidly create its own remedy.
For, at the station stop immediately subsequent to the complete
filling of the tank and its consequent dribbling, the fact of the
porter’s forgetfulness would be made painfully evident by toilet
discharges upon the station platform. It should be remembered
in this connection that the porter can not help himself in such an
emergency by locking the toilet doors.</p>

<p>The above device is now being experimented with upon a stationary
basis in order to secure the maximum simplification of details
and to secure data upon steam consumption, and bacterial
efficiency. As soon as these studies are completed experimental devices
will be placed upon vessels and railway coaches and tested in
actual service. It is believed that the cost of operation will be
extremely low. Rough preliminary office estimates indicate that the
cost of disinfection with the above device should not be over two-tenths
of a cent per cubic foot of sewage disinfected. This preliminary
estimate is based upon the assumption that 1 pound of coal
in the average modern locomotive will evaporate 6 pounds of water,
and that locomotive coal costs $1.50 per ton delivered into the locomotive.
This certainly should be more than sufficient allowance for
radiation.</p>

<p>Based on the above estimate, sewage disinfection for a railway
coach which used 10 cubic feet per day for toilet flushing will cost
about 2 cents per day. The cost for steamers will probably be somewhat
higher owing to the greater amount of water used per toilet
flush.</p>

<p>An estimate of 5 or 10 cents per closet per day would seem reasonable.
The steamers could, of course, reduce this considerably by
substituting railway toilets for their present equipment.</p>

<p>That is, briefly, a description of the manner in which the tank
works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What temperature is the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. We have been experimenting with the tank since
January, and in none of our tests has the temperature at which
discharge began been lower than 190° F., and that has only been
when I have put steam in at such a high rate that it rose through
the water so rapidly to the surface as not to condense as in the
usual adjustment. In practically all of the experiments where I
have so adjusted the steam valve—mind you, this has an automatic
adjustment, too—as to cause the time of heating to be about 15 or
20 minutes, the temperature has always been between 200 and 212,
practically boiling, always above the killing temperature for pathogenic
organisms. I should say it was, roughly, <span class="lock">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. One hundred and seven?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. No; about 160° F., which is equivalent to 60° C.
The device may be regulated so that the discharge is never under
200. I think that the effect of the temperature can be illustrated
by the results of our tests. We have never in any case been able
to recover B. coli from the effluent, except once, in a great many
tests. I have forgotten how many there were. In this one case I
put the steam at such a high pressure that the discharge took place
in only two or three minutes. Now, it is possible, in the manner of
installing the device upon a vessel, to make it absolutely impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
for that to take place. I say that because I have been operating
with 100 pounds steam pressure in Washington and reducing it
down to about 5; and it is always possible on some vessels to make
the line carry anything you want by a proper reducing valve. And
if this line can be brought to somewhere about 10 to 15 pounds per
square inch it is physically impossible for the discharge to take
place in anything less than 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>As regards what has been done toward installing the device on
vessels, this experiment has been almost entirely due to the courtesy
of <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> William Livingstone, president of the Lake Carriers’ Association.
As you will remember, some time ago he offered to provide
for the commission one or more vessels for experimentation.
He has now made good that promise, and last week I was in Cleveland,
and initiated the installation of the apparatus with which I
have been experimenting in Washington since January upon the
<i>D. G. Kerr</i>, just recently off the ways, and now completed, I believe,
from what I heard in Cleveland. The installation of the device
will be completed about to-morrow, and the first trip of the
vessel is scheduled to begin Wednesday morning. I expect to make
that trip on her. In regard to the future experimental work with
the device, I do not think it ought to be too quick. I think we ought
to take a fair amount of time to satisfy ourselves as to the manner
in which the device works. I do not think one or two trips are
enough to tell whether it will work or not. We have been experimenting
with the device upon a stationary basis at a pumping station.
That means no motion of the device; and it is certainly desirable
to determine how it will act on a rolling vessel, and that will
be the object of the present experiments during the coming season.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Do you foresee that the rolling of the vessel will
make any difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. At present I can not see any definite trouble that is
likely to result. With the rolling of the vessel I foresee that when
the tank is half full the surface of the water in the tank may be
caused to sway at an angle depending upon the rolling of the vessel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is the size of the tank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. This tank with which I have been experimenting,
which is designed for a group of toilets, is 24 inches in diameter by
30 inches long, and I have instructed them to place it longitudinally
with the ship, so that the least wave action will take place from rolling.
The ship on which this has been placed, for example, is 500 or
600 feet long and does not receive much effect from pitching. It is
too long for that on the Great Lakes, but it does experience rolling,
so that I have exposed the short portion of the tank to the rolling.
The only thing that I can see might happen is this, that before the
tank fills to the point where, normally, the steam is turned on automatically,
the wave action will turn on the steam so that steam will
enter the device. Also, if the tank is in the act of discharging, and
the vessel rolls, and, say, if it is half discharged, then if one side
of the tank on which the float is situated should be temporarily depressed,
it would shut off the steam before the sewage had quite
discharged. But I can not see any harm in it. It simply, momentarily,
during the storm, reduces the capacity of the tank and makes
the steam turn on oftener and reduces the capacity of the tank. That
is the only effect I can see. I am also anticipating a possible knocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
of the float on the inside of the tank by the insertion of stoppage
lugs fitted by buffer springs. If the rolling were serious the buffer
might be knocked against the top of the tank and be water-logged,
and I am endeavoring to stop that by the insertion of buffer lugs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the capacity of your tank in gallons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. About 70 gallons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Would that suffice for a fairly large vessel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. That would suffice only for about half a dozen toilets,
and if a vessel had a group of half a dozen toilets in the rear and
half a dozen forward they would require to have two tanks. It is
not necessary to delimit the side of the tanks to say how large the
tanks should be. I think it would be much wiser to let that problem
be solved for each particular vessel. The older vessels have a great
many toilets, and would require more tanks. The newer vessels,
which have fewer toilets, would have correspondingly fewer tanks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the cost of the outfit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. It is difficult to say, but I should say it would not be
expensive. The experimental tank which we have built in Washington,
which is designed for six toilets, cost $600, but remember
that is experimental, and one of the engineers whom I had to help
me put three-sixteenths steel. That is more like building a warship,
and it does not require to be so heavy. In practice it would not come
to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Could you install it in vessels already built?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. It depends on the character of the vessel. I think
it is comparatively easy. The <i>D. G. Kerr</i> has been built already
and had the soil pipe already inserted. The master mechanic, with
whom I was talking yesterday about the installation of the device,
stated that he thought it would take, roughly, 24 hours to install
that tank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. In what part of the vessel is it placed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. This particular experimental tank is being placed aft.
Of course the tanks in practice would be placed wherever the soil
pipes happened to be built.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is this a freight vessel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. Yes. The cost of the operation, I think, will be
almost negligible. We had this experimental device installed in
the sewage pumping station in Washington, where we had a steam
pressure of about 100 pounds per square inch and boilers of about
100 horsepower. It was impossible at any time to observe any effect
whatever on those boilers when this device was receiving steam at
its maximum flow, and I simply mentioned that to indicate that
there would be no observable, even temporary, effect upon the steam
supply for the engines in the vessels. There is no such great consumption
of steam. I can explain to you steamboat people when
I say that a half or three-quarter inch pipe will carry all the steam
you need.</p>

<p>As regards the cost of operation, I have not the figures with me just
now, but I computed, theoretically allowing 100 per cent additional
cost for radiation, and I got 13 per cent for everything, including the
amount by which the steam had already condensed in the pipe lines.
I think the cost of operation goes away down to point zero something.
If you figure it out upon the theoretical heat units that are
known absolutely to be in the steam, there is no other conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
but that the cost of operation of the device is negligible, and that
the only thing which really need concern you is the cost of installation
of the device. However, as regards operation, I think it would
be better to wait for confirmation after the device is tried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is the only contamination of the water by steamboats
that which is discharged from closets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I think it can safely be assumed that the only part of
steamboat discharge which has a pathogenic significance is that coming
from the closets and urinals. I do not think any other particular
discharge need concern us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The meats, or anything of that kind, can not become
affected, being thrown into the water? Would that not have some
effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I do not know, but I think that the frequency of
occurrence of infected meats upon vessels would be so low that any
infection of the waters due thereto would be negligible and would
be dissipated quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You could take care of that as a separate problem;
give it a dose of steam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I think some kitchen rules could be formulated that
would take care of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What temperature Fahrenheit would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. You could so regulate the device that it would be
physically <span class="lock">impossible——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But what degree of heat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. Between 200 and 212. The device can be regulated
so that it will never discharge under 200, and is practically always
210. At centigrade the pathogenic temperature is 60.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Don’t you think the complete sanitary requirements
should call for some sterilization of refuse matter of the kitchen?
If you were prescribing sanitary rules to be observed by the lake
carrying trade, would it not be wise to make some provision for
sterilization of refuse matter from the kitchen in the form of infected
meats, or anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I do not think I would be prepared, without a good
deal further thought, to say so. I have not given it any thought in
the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I was trying to get at whether your system would
be complete in itself for the purpose of preventing contamination of
these waters by reason of steamboat navigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I believe it could be safely said that, inasmuch as
probably away over 99 per cent of all infected pollution which is
discharged from the vessel is discharged through the toilets and
urinals, emphasis might reasonably be laid only on those for the
present, until it is definitely shown that real infection can result
from the meats or kitchen waste. As I say, I have not thought of
the problem in connection with the kitchen, and I really do not know
whether you could, by discharging this waste, produce much affection
or any affection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It would not be a difficult matter to sterilize them
with an iron tank with a cover to prevent the escape of steam and
a cock to turn on the steam. It is easy enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. Yes. If the meat or any of the feed were in large
pieces, all that would be necessary would be to chop it up into relatively
fine pieces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It would not cost more than $25 or $30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I would not place it quite so cheap.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. It could all be burned in the furnace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is very little new under the sun. Very nearly
this same appliance has been in use on the Muskoka Lakes in their
steamboats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. Then I will be interested to know how it works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You are not in a position to estimate the cost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I would prefer to wait until these experiments furnish
me with actual figures on board ship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It is comparatively small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I think it could be safely said to be negligible, as far
as steam consumption is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Have you made any inquiry as to whether or not the
garbage could be disposed of by an incinerating plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Or whether the cost of an incinerating plant would
exceed the cost of the plant you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I think <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps’s suggestion to simply throw
the kitchen refuse which is thought to be infected into the furnace
is the most simple and obvious that has been suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Your plant does not take care of anything but the
excreta from the closets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. It does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. So that the vegetable matter and all that would
have to be dealt with. After you have sterilized it you would throw
it into the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. After you have sterilized it and cast it into the water
and it goes to the shore, would it not become a menace again by
coming back into the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. No; because the pathogenic organisms can not grow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Is it not a fact that in erecting ordinary dwellings
they have an incinerating plant, by which they take care of the
garbage by burning it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. It may be done in country homes, but it is not done
on vessels.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. I am much interested in the description of the
device given by this gentleman, and I may say that on the Muskoka
Lakes, where about 30,000 people go every year, we carry out in
principle what he proposes. We have not the automatic device that
he has, but what we have answers the purpose very well. The sewage
all goes into a large tank, and live steam is turned into that for 20
minutes. The requirement is that the effluent shall not be poured
into any of the harbors; it must be turned into the middle of the
lake. All the steamboats are under one company, and they are very
willing to carry out this device or arrangement because it is a good
advertisement for them. They are catering entirely to passenger
and freight and bringing people to this summer resort, so that our
task in getting them to establish the arrangement is an easy one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Now, we are beginning to establish similar arrangements on the
boats plying around Georgian Bay. With regard to the garbage
which is thrown from the boats, I do not think we have very much
complaint about the Muskoka Lakes, because it is eaten up by the
gulls and birds found in large numbers on the waters. I am very
much interested in the description of this device, and will be glad to
know it is a satisfactory one, because if it turns out to be so, it will
probably be established on our boats when any new ones come in to be
equipped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Regarding the tank installed on the Muskoka
Lakes, is the effluent rendered harmless?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. I think undoubtedly, because the steam is turned
on for 20 minutes, and I think that would settle everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the cost of the plant?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. It is comparatively small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I think about $100 would be the cost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I have here a letter which the chairman asked me
to present. It reads as follows:</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF COL. WILLIAM LIVINGSTONE,<br>
OF DETROIT, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr>,<br>
PRESIDENT LAKE CARRIERS’ ASSOCIATION.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. I do not think I have anything to present different
from what I stated to the commission before. I stated that
so far as our Lake Carriers’ Association was concerned we would
gladly cooperate with you in carrying out the objects by every means
in our power, and at that time, in the course of the long discussion
that ensued, I stated that I would be glad to put a boat or two, or
more boats, as the case might be, at your disposal, to test any plan
which the health board wanted to try out. Mr. Frank went over the
ground. It is useless for me to repeat that. He came to me and I
arranged to put a boat at his disposal. He has the apparatus installed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
and he can have the use of her for testing as long as he
pleases. Our thought about the matter summed up is this: We are
willing to cooperate with you in any way in our power, but we have
this feeling about it decidedly, that, whatever apparatus is adopted
we feel that it ought to be thoroughly tested and carried beyond the
experimental stage, so to speak, and that the experts should be satisfied
that the plants installed will accomplish the purpose for which
they are installed, because otherwise, if we were to adopt a mechanical
device to accomplish this purpose and to put it on board our boats
costing a great many thousand dollars and then found after we had
installed them that they would not work properly and had to tear
them out, the result would be a loss of time and money, and no possible
good would result. We have some 16 steamers, and naturally
the cost would be great. We feel now that it is just in the experimental
stage. We do not feel that the time has arrived at which the
health bureau are prepared to say, “If you install this device it will
be satisfactory and accomplish the result”; but as soon as they are
prepared to say, “We have tested this out; we have given it a thorough
test; and we are satisfied in our minds that it will accomplish
the purpose set forth,” then we will say, “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>May I add one thing? I want it to be clearly understood that I
am not asking that our boats be exempt from any part of their duty
to be performed to the general public, but it seems to me the matter
has been overstated, to some extent. I am not putting it in by way of
defense or expiation. I may say that we have in our employ approximately
17,000 people. If you take all the men employed on all the
boats on the Great Lakes—call it 25,000, if you please—we employ
the majority of them, and it must be remembered that they are not
depositing their sewage or excretion into the water at any one point,
and the idea that they can pollute and contaminate the waters to the
same extent that this great city of 700,000 inhabitants can, with the
sewers flowing into the river, is simply impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It is not only the sewage deposited by the employees
of the vessels you speak of, but the steamboat population of the Great
Lakes in 1913 was 50,000,000 souls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. I know that; we carried nearly 14,000,000 out
of Detroit. I am not making any defense. I am not asking that they
be treated differently from any other citizens of the United States.
We do not ask for one blessed thing in the way of exemption. We
stand up and try to do our full share as citizens of the country. I
have lived in Detroit all my life, nearly, and have a large family,
and am just as much interested in Detroit as any man living here can
possibly be, and just as anxious we should get pure water to drink as
any man living. I am not putting it upon the ground of cost either.
It is not a question of dollars and cents. I want that understood.
The point we want to be satisfied on is that it will work efficiently.</p>

<p>I have been connected entirely with freight boats. The average
crew is about 25. The passenger boats carry a larger complement.
Unless I misunderstood him, Mr. Sloman said that the water board
sent me a letter, I think, nearly, if not quite, two years ago and asked
that on account of the intake pipe near Detroit, which is up at the
head of Belle Isle on the American side, we should make some arrangement
that for several miles above that we would have our
closets closed until we had passed that intake pipe. We complied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
with it, and I am not sure whether all the passenger lines complied
with it. I know I personally asked them all, and I am reasonably
sure the request was complied with. Nothing was deposited anywhere
near the intake pipe. I went into this matter fully and exhaustively
at the last meeting of the commission, and we stand now
just where we did then. Anything you gentlemen decide, after giving
it careful and exhaustive study, we stand ready to abide by, but
we think it has not yet been tested out sufficiently, and I think <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Phelps will agree with me that they have not yet got to the point
where they will say it will do the work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Mr. Sloman made quite a point about the garbage
from steamers as being an injury to property. There must be a
tremendous amount of garbage where there is such a heavy passenger
traffic each season.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. That is true. Where do you live, Mr. Sloman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Up at Sans Souci.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. On Harrisons Island?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. I will say that the orders are peremptory that
no garbage shall be thrown into the river, but, of course, it is impossible
to control all our vessels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. What is done with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. Sometimes it is thrown into the Lakes, but I
do not claim to make any point on that, because it is not handled
as well as it should be handled, but we do the best we can with the
facilities we have. However, I want to emphasize one thing—that
the orders are peremptory that in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair and Detroit Rivers
no garbage shall be thrown, and you know that I know whereof I
speak. The man that is reported for doing that will get the short
shrift. Of course it is clearly understood that we have careless
employees the same as anybody else. Sometimes on a dark night,
if the cook thinks it is too much trouble to put the garbage into a
receptacle which we provide for it, he throws it over the rail. I
presume that sometimes happens, but I am speaking of the general
orders. If I have not filed the sanitary rules which we have published,
I will be glad to file them. These rules are given to all the
members of the crews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Have you ever ascertained the rules in Europe on
the vessels? You have traveled on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. I know nothing, except being a passenger on the
ocean. I know the methods of taking care of the garbage for the
cities generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Would you think burning garbage by an incinerating
plant on the vessel, and keeping the excreta from the closet
in a sealed can and distributing on the land would cost more than
the apparatus your engineers are figuring on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. I can not answer that question. I have to refer
these matters to those men who are experts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Would it be possible to incinerate the garbage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. Oh, yes; I think it would. I am not prepared
to say just how. You can do anything, but the question is as to
how practical it will be. It may be so difficult to carry out as to
make it impossible. There is nothing you can not do if you try.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You can throw it into the furnace. That is incinerator
enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. That would hardly be a method.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Livingstone</span>. I am not here to suggest a plan. I am here
to tell you we will adopt any feasible plan you suggest. We simply
say the experiments have not gone far enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. King, have you anything to offer as the representative
of the Dominion Marine Association?</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. FRANCIS KING, K. C.,<br>OF KINGSTON, REPRESENTING<br>
THE DOMINION MARINE ASSOCIATION.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. Just a word. I will ask the commission to pardon me
if I should repeat a little of what the President of the Lake Carriers’
Association has said, as I was not able to catch all that he said—in
fact I must confess that I failed to hear a great part of his remarks,
owing to the noise outside. But I began to pay strict attention when
this gentleman [Mr. Sloman] preferred that very vehement indictment
against the vessels passing through the waters in question. I
am not going to say very much on that point, but I ask the commission
to weigh the accuracy of his statements in some measure by the
accuracy of his knowledge of the position of the owners of these
vessels. I do not think I have to repeat to the commission, but I
will say it again for this gentleman’s benefit, and the commission
will pardon me. What we said at the previous session of the commission
at Detroit—and what I am sure Mr. Livingstone has already
said, although I could not hear him—was that we were in an attitude
of cheerful willingness to place ourselves in the hands of the commission,
and I speak on behalf of all the tonnage on the Canadian
side between Port Arthur, the head of the Lakes, and Montreal. We
place ourselves in the hands of the commission, trusting the commission
will only bring into force, or recommend that the respective
Governments pass legislation that will be fair and reasonable. We
want to do what is right. We are as much interested as anybody in
preventing the pollution of the waters, and I urge—and I wish to
emphasize it very strongly—that nothing should be done without
the fullest and most complete test. I think the commission is at
one with that suggestion and will act upon it.</p>

<p>With regard to what has been done by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps and Mr.
Frank, I trust that nothing will be done until you have had the
fullest and most complete test of the proposals. I submit the test
should be had not only on one trip but throughout the season, that
it should include all weather and should include all seasons, and it
should deal with the question of interference by frost, that the test
should be carried out not only on the large freighters but on passenger
boats, on which the conditions may vary, and that it should
be carried out on boats of different sizes and engaged in different
trades. It would be a matter of multiplying the test by three or
four or five in order to cover the various conditions; but I do ask
that this delay should take place, not for the purpose of postponing
unduly any action that ought to be taken by vessel owners, but
because the conditions are so different from those in regard to municipalities.
In a municipality a tremendous amount of money is
going to be spent before one knows absolutely what the effect is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to be, and you are practically committed to that scheme. In the case
of a boat you have an opportunity to decide upon the best scheme,
having regard to the practicability, the cost and effectiveness, and
I trust the commission will be governed to some extent by the consideration
of cost, if it is to be granted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Would you consider it a hardship if the steamboat
companies were required to place an apparatus on one of their boats
at their own expense, with the understanding that if satisfactory
they should complete the equipment on all their vessels; otherwise
it would go no further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I do not quite understand the suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Would the companies consider it a hardship if they
were required to install one of these machines at their own expense
for experimental purposes, that they should pay for it at their own
<span class="lock">expense——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. And if it was bad not to install it on the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Let the commissioners decide whether they should
go on or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. The vessel owners are willing to do whatever is right,
and possibly this machine may not be the best. We do not know
what may be invested in the next year or two. In view of the
infinitesimal proportion of the sewage which can be credited to the
boats, immediate haste is not necessary, and if it is going to take 5
or 10 years to settle the question with regard to the municipalities,
it would be better to spend the money for the purpose of testing
rather than committing ourselves to one appliance which may not
answer the purpose. I am not urging delay for the sake of delay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I gather from your statement that the steamboat
companies would not be willing to install this apparatus on all of
their boats simply upon the result of one test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That being the case, in order to get something which
would be satisfactory to the steamboat companies, we would have to
install this or some other apparatus on two or three boats, or a sufficient
number of them to satisfy the steamboat companies that they
were feasible and practicable, at the expense of the two Governments,
which this commission has not the power to do. The question
was whether or not, to carry out your idea, if we could possibly do
so, the steamboat companies were not willing to install a few of these
machines on these boats at their own expense, for the purpose of
testing their feasibility and practicability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I am not in a position to give an answer on that point
on behalf of the companies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We are not in a position to commit the two Governments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I do think both associations are willing to do whatever
you would consider reasonable in that way, and I think it might be
possible here and there to effect an installation, in order to get a sure
test of the appliances. I do not say that should be done, but I think
the vessel owners are willing to do it. I think the first cost should
be borne by the public till the inspection is done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I am glad to get your idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. Our attitude is one of absolute fairness in the matter.
May I say one more thing in regard to the point I was urging, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
unduly? That is the lack of necessity for haste in the case of a
vessel. You spoke of the steamboat population of the boats. May I
point out that that population is a population as individuals for
periods averaging from an hour to a day. They are not engaged
in the pollution of the waters for 365 days in the year. That consideration
is somewhat overlooked. One more remark: It was suggested
by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps that steamboats ought to be dealt with at
present, in spite of the municipalities’ pollution, because of the fact
that they pass the intake pipes for the waterworks systems. May I
suggest that while the tests are going on, it would be a simple matter
to devise rules whereby lavatory doors are locked just as they are
locked on trains, at times when the contamination might take place?
They could be closed when they are passing in close proximity to the
intakes. A move in that line might possibly meet what was in Mr.
Phelps’s mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is it not a fact that there is danger also on account
of vessels taking their water for drinking purposes in polluted areas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I do not think that is a danger which the commission
should deal with. I think we can carry it out by orders that the
water should not be taken except in certain restricted areas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is it not a fact that considerable typhoid fever has
been caused by that means in the past?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I can not admit that. I know of one case where a suit
was entered at Rochester, and tried, but no decision yet. I know of
no other cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I know of several cases in southern Minnesota attributed
to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. At the same time, I must admit that contamination does
exist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. There is a great probability of contamination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. In the matter of taking water ballast in polluted
areas and discharging that ballast in less polluted areas, as they
arrive near the ports—what have you to say to that? Would it be
a hardship if they were required not to take on water ballast in
polluted areas, or else not to discharge it in the less polluted areas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I do not think it would be a hardship, except in cases
where the exigencies of navigation required them to fill their tanks
before they got out of a certain area. There are cases where boats
must have their tanks filled before they get out of the landlocked
harbor. A boat coming from Kingston must have her tanks filled
before she gets into Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Could there not be some regulation in regard to the
discharge of that ballast in the vicinity of intakes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I think that could be sufficiently covered with the one
provision. They have to keep her sufficiently trimmed in stress of
weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. You spoke a moment ago about the cost of trying
out the question and solving the problem—that it should not be
thrown upon the vessel owners. Mr. Livingstone had made an
offer—at least he has done something toward experimentation at
considerable <span class="lock">cost——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. Excuse me; it is at no cost to Mr. Livingstone or the
Lake Carriers’ Association. I understand it is borne by others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Would it be any cost to your vessels to try out the
incinerating of your garbage by putting it in your furnace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I do not think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. Would it involve a large cost to have a septic tank in
your holds, running your closets to that tank, sterilizing the contents
and bringing it to port, and carrying it away to the land somewhere?
Would that involve a large cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I think it would, but I do not know. I have no direct
knowledge of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sloman</span>. What do you think as to whether or not that would
be a practical way of solving the problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I would not set my judgment up against that of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Phelps and Mr. Frank, who have gone more deeply into the subject
than I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>. I think that may be answered by saying that in order
to store all of the sewage for a voyage until a port is reached the
tank would have to be many times as large as this small stream tank
which I have described, and the cost would be almost, although not
quite, proportionate to the volume. In addition, the expense of disposal
after the land was reached would have to be met. I think it
may be stated without any doubt whatever that any device holding
the sewage throughout a whole voyage would obviously cost much
more than a device for holding it for about two hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Mr. King, you are willing to do anything that we
may prescribe, but you ask us not to recommend that you be required
to spend money on schemes that in their experimental stage
may prove abortive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. Quite true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I understand that the representatives of the city
of Detroit will not be ready to proceed until the session to-morrow
morning. Is there anyone else here who desires to be heard?</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. H. L. BLOMSHIELD,<br>
OF TRENTON, <abbr title="Michigan">MICH.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. I would like to speak on behalf of the village of
Trenton. I am sorry that I am here to represent a village that has
shown such half-hearted interest in the recommendations of your
consulting sanitary engineer, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps. The attitude taken by
the village authorities is no doubt due to the fact that local conditions
have called for much quicker action on the part of the State board
of health in recommending certain remedial measures for their local
benefit.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that there are about 12 sewer outlets
above the intake, and it has been urged upon the village authorities
to construct a 12-inch intercepting trunk sewer to divert this sewage
below the intake.</p>

<p>It has appeared to the majority of the residents that the tail end
of the district has been tackled first. I can say that I believe they will
be in hearty accord with any remedial measures your commission
may adopt for the entire district.</p>

<p>From a standpoint of economy and future supervision, I believe a
metropolitan district could best serve the Michigan side. I derived
this thought from a lecture on the “Metropolitan District of Boston,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
by Mr. Frederick Fay before the District Engineering Society several
months ago.</p>

<p>I have read several press reports on this subject as viewed by Mr.
Hubbell, our district consulting sanitary engineer. As outlined, I
believe the district would extend from the Macomb to the Monroe
County lines. It appeals to me more forcibly in that each community
will be served alike and pay pro rata for benefits derived.</p>

<p>In going over the past history of improvements recommended for
Trenton, I will say that about seven years ago an extensive combined
sewerage system was planned at an estimated cost of approximately
$50,000, which the people voted down. They have never had
the opportunity to vote on a sanitary system, which I believe would
cost about $18,000.</p>

<p>The finances of the village are in such shape that this price would
go beyond the 5 per cent mark of bonded indebtedness. I might give
the figures showing the present condition of the finances. In the
meantime, before I give that I would like to ask a question. If
recommendations are carried out in the several districts, does the
commission give any method of raising the funds necessary to carry
on such work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is a matter that the commission has not yet
considered at all, and I do not know whether it is within the scope
of our work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. If the several districts had the funds with which
to do it, I believe that some of these measures would have been
taken up long ago. The assessed valuation of our village in 1915 was
$555,200, bonded as follows: Highway-improvement bonds, $6,500;
electric-light plant, $7,500; other bonds, $6,125; total, $20,125; of
which $3,500 has been paid off, leaving a balance to be paid of
$16,625. One per cent, which is the allowable limit for any improvements
in any one year for any special kind of improvements, would
make $5,552; or 5 per cent, which is the total limit of bonded indebtedness,
would make $27,760, of which $16,625 has already been
bonded, leaving a balance of $11,135, which you see is very much
less than would pay for a sanitary sewerage system which the village
surely needs.</p>

<p>I have acted as village engineer for Trenton during the past year,
and without funds to promote any measures of sanitary work or
water purification we are very much handicapped. If the commission
in recommending any remedial measures could also embody any
method of raising funds to carry on the work, it would be greatly
appreciated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Why do you recommend the metropolitan district—on
account of the saving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. On account of the saving to the smaller districts
per capita.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You would not have the overhead charges to meet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. That is it; and that is something that the smaller
communities could not stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is the borrowing power of Trenton to-day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. Five per cent; but they have $11,000 yet to
borrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is there no provision to meet a case like that where
certain improvements are ordered by the State board of health?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. I believe 5 per cent is the point set by the State
law for villages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It is set by your constitution, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. In a case like that, where it is a matter of public
necessity, have you not the power to levy a special assessment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. Nothing we know about yet. We have asked
several authorities on that and we have not been enlightened on that
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. As a matter of fact, what is your head of taxation,
the village?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. The village. The village takes in a very small
area. It should be enlarged. That is one method that would be
furthered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you a county tax besides that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And a State tax?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. And a State tax. Our taxes now are $17.50 per
thousand, or $1.75 per hundred. That is the total tax for the village.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is all combined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. That is all combined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Well, you are happy boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I understand your chief objection is lack of funds
with which to carry out the improvements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. If that were removed, there would be no difficulty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. There would be no difficulty. As I say, if some
system were laid out for the entire district the village of Trenton
would be heartily in accord with such a system. Due to the local conditions
which have prompted immediate action, they feel that they are
being called out to start the thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. There is no intention to single them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Our desire would be to treat them all alike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Malone</span>. Do you not think that if the Federal Government
were to impose a penalty for not putting in a filtration plant that
they would find ways and means of getting the necessary money to
put it in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blomshield</span>. I guess they would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there any other person here that desires to be
heard this afternoon? As there is not, the commission will take a
recess until 10 o’clock to-morrow morning.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. GEORGE H. FENKELL,<br>COMMISSIONER OF
PUBLIC WORKS OF THE CITY OF DETROIT.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Fenkell, will you please state what the city of
Detroit has done in connection with the consulting engineer of the
commission in the matter of investigating the remedies for existing
pollution? Before you go into the technical matters, kindly give a
sort of summary or history of the part your city has taken and what
they are doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Your commission met in Detroit about a year and a
half ago, and immediately after that meeting I asked the common
council for funds to begin work on an investigation as to conditions
existing in the Detroit River. Only $15,000 has been provided.
Shortly after that Mr. Clarence W. Hubbell, of Detroit, was engaged
to make an investigation and report. A little later he occupied joint
offices with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps.</p>

<p>That investigation was carried on until Mr. Hubbell’s report was
submitted, about four weeks ago. It was put into the hands of the
printer immediately and yesterday we received the first copies. I
was able to deliver only three copies to you yesterday. I hope soon
to have more from the printer. That report was submitted to the
council shortly after it was received from Mr. Hubbell. The summary
was printed in the council’s proceedings, a copy of which, I
believe, was mailed to your commission.</p>

<p>Because of the haste in getting the report to the printer the typewritten
report was not read generally. In fact, I think I was the
only one that was able to look the report over before it went to the
printer. None of the Detroit officials is familiar with Mr. Hubbell’s
report except such portions as appeared in the council’s proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Hubbell and the sanitary engineer of the commission,
then, were working together for the last year, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I think so. Just how they divided the work and
how they carried out the details I am unable to state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. They were jointly studying the same problem at
the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. They were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Now, what have you to say, Mr. Fenkell, in regard
to the plans recommended by the consulting sanitary engineer of the
commission, and how do these plans compare with the plans or
remedies proposed by Mr. Hubbell, your sanitary engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I am unable to state exactly. I have read Mr. Hubbell’s
report through twice, and I have read <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps’s report
through, but I have been unable to make any extended study of the
matter. So far I hardly think anyone has, except it be Mr. Hubbell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has your municipal government here considered the
question of the standards for sewage treatment and water purification
recommended by the sanitary engineers of the commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. So far as I know, it has not received any extended
study, except by Mr. Hubbell. Mr. Hubbell’s report was transmitted
to the common council, and it was submitted to the proper committee,
but the committee have been unable to take any action in the matter,
or study it, because of our inability to furnish copies of the report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has the city at this time in contemplation anything
looking toward sewage treatment, independent of any international
question involved in the pollution of the Detroit River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. No more than is covered by Mr. Hubbell’s report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have no specific plan in preparation, is what I
mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are you treating your sewage here at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. In no way whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are discharging raw sewage into the Detroit
River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is the outlet for all your sewerage system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. All of your sewers discharge into the Detroit River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes, sir. Some do not discharge directly into the
river, but they reach the Detroit River eventually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Ultimately all of the sewage goes into the Detroit
River untreated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Where do you get your water from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. It is taken from a point about 700 feet above Belle
Isle, in the American Channel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you a filtration plant there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Detroit has no filtration plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you chlorinate the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. The process in use is chlorination. Mr. Leisen, the
general superintendent for the water commission, is present and can
explain that to you in detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Magrath calls my attention to the fact that we
went into that matter when we were here a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I think, if I may be permitted to make the suggestion,
that there have been some changes in the method of treating the
water since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Well, that is important. Now, Mr. Fenkell, before
we hear Mr. Hubbell, is there anything else in relation to the subject
that you desire to bring to the attention of the commission at this
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. There may have been explained to the commission
the ordinary way in which the city would proceed to get the funds
and go ahead with work of this kind. My understanding is that it
would first be necessary for the council to direct that the matter be
voted on by the people. It would then go up at a regular election,
and in order for the work to be authorized or the bonds to be issued
it would have to receive 60 per cent of the votes cast. The work
would be carried out by and through the department of public works
working with the common council. I can give you still further
details regarding that, if you wish, as well as copies of the law
relating thereto.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the present bonded debt of the city of
Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I will secure that data and give it to you later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have a limited amount of bonded indebtedness
to which the city can obligate itself, have you not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. It is limited. I will give you that data later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That limit is 5 per cent of the assessed value of the
property, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I am unable to state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Any such limitation as that is a constitutional provision
of the State, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I am unable to state the amount. Detroit now has
home rule, and just what the limitation is when the people vote on a
question of that kind I am unable to state. Would the chairman like
to have me secure that data?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. We would like to have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I would suggest that if you have any other questions
of that kind you give me a list of them, and I will secure the desired
information for you, or you can call on the city comptroller and
secure the information from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We desire simply to ascertain what the position of
the city would be with reference to carrying out any plan looking to
the prevention of this pollution which now exists. That would be
the only way in which it would be material for us to know whether
the city was situated so that it could carry out any reasonable recommendations
that might be made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You are filing with us a copy of the report of Mr.
Hubbell, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. So far I have furnished 3 copies. I have received
only 12 printed copies and have been able to give reports to only
three of the departments of the city that I thought would be interested.
I shall be pleased to furnish the commission additional copies
as soon as we receive them. We hope to receive them to-day or
to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I understand you to say that no action has yet been
taken on Mr. Hubbell’s report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. No action whatever. Upon its receipt it was transmitted
to the council, and within 48 hours it was in the hands of the
printer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. It was referred to the committee, I suppose, for
consideration and printed as all public documents are printed. Is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. The report was referred to the committee on sewers.
Only my letter transmitting the report and the summary of Mr. Hubbell’s
report were printed in the council’s proceedings because of the
necessity for cuts, maps, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is it contemplated to take any action on Mr. Hubbell’s
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. That is something that I am unable to say. The
matter is now before the sewer committee of the common council, and
in the natural course of events it would be considered by that committee
and a report thereon submitted to the common council. The
matter could then be acted on by the common council, or any action
could be taken that the council saw fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How many members constitute the council?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. There are 42 members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I understand you also to say that before any final
action would be taken on Mr. Hubbell’s report the matter would be
submitted to the taxpayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. In order to issue bonds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Simply to issue bonds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Otherwise, it would not be submitted to the taxpayers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Probably not unless it required a change in the city’s
charter. A change in the charter requires a vote of 50 per cent or
more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. And to issue bonds you require 60 per cent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes; 60 per cent. The vote on the Belle Isle Bridge
bonds a year ago failed because it received only 58 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. That was the case of a contemplated bond issue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Mr. Fenkell, I see that in your letter to Mr. Hubbell,
dated November 25, 1914, you decided to submit certain problems
for his consideration, the second one being, “To what extent
does the city of Detroit sewage pollute American waters so as to
render them unfit as a source of raw water for filtration purposes?”
Mr. Hubbell’s reply to that certainly has the right ring to it. It is
stated in paragraph No. 7 of his report, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In regard to the second part of the problem as to what expense would be
justified for sewage treatment, it is difficult to formulate an answer in terms of
money alone. However, it is believed that, aside from the international features
of the problem, the combined benefits which would accrue from a more cleanly
water front, purer water at the bathing beaches and summer playgrounds,
reduction in typhoid and other water-borne diseases, due to the use of sewage-laden
water along the river front; betterment of raw-water supplies for the
municipalities below the city, and the protection of Detroit’s water from gross
sewage pollution at times when the Detroit River flows backward amply justify
the expenditure required for sewage-treatment works as above outlined. In
round figures, the cost would be about $6,000,000, and in my judgment the
expenditure of this sum would be justifiable.</p>
</div>

<p>I would like to say, Mr. Chairman, that I think this commission
should put itself on record with Mr. Fenkell to the effect that we
have been in a delicate position and have had a delicate piece of
work to attend to, and the city of Detroit has played up magnificently
in connection with this investigation. I think it is only fair to make
that admission to these gentlemen. So far as I am concerned as a
member of this commission, I appreciate the good work that the city
of Detroit has done, and I am quite confident that the city of Detroit
will do its duty in the matter. I think, Mr. Fenkell, that we are
indebted to you and to your mayor and the members of your city
council for the way in which you have always met us here in connection
with this problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Chairman, I desire to say that I think that expresses
the views of the commission generally. There have been certainly
very high appreciation and cooperation in the city of Detroit,
and we have every reason to believe that the city will join in any
recommendation we may make to the two Governments for the purpose
of solving this problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. I may say, Mr. Chairman, that it has been our endeavor
to work along the lines laid down by the commission, and I
know it is the wish of the mayor to do what he can to further your
efforts and to work in cooperation with the cities and towns on the
Canadian side of the river. He feels that the American cities and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the Canadian cities are so closely knit together that the welfare of
one must work for the welfare of the other. I know that he wants to
do everything he can to further anything that will be beneficial to
the cities on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>I want to thank the members of this commission, both officially
and personally, for your kindness in the matter, and to assure you
that we shall welcome any suggestion that you may have to offer, and
we will continue to work along lines that may seem to you and to
your commission to be proper and right.</p>

<p>If there is any further information that I can give you, I shall
be pleased to do so. The mayor would have been here this morning
had it been possible, and he may be here later. Should there be any
information that you would like me to secure, I would be glad to
obtain it from the comptroller, the corporation counsel, or any of the
other city officials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I think the information that the commission would
like to have, Mr. Fenkell, is the present bonded indebtedness of the
city, and, if there is a limitation upon the power of the city to incur
obligations of that kind, what that limitation is and how near you
have reached it. If you will kindly have prepared a statement along
that line, we will incorporate it in the record as a part of your statement
of this morning. If you have nothing further to say, we will
now hear Mr. Hubbell.</p>

<p>(The information called for with respect to the assessed valuation
of property and the bonded indebtedness of the city of Detroit appears
in the statement of Mr. George Engel, the city’s comptroller.)</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. CLARENCE W. HUBBELL,<br>CONSULTING SANITARY
ENGINEER OF THE CITY OF DETROIT.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Hubbell, I think you had better state for the
record what work, if any, you have done in connection with the consulting
engineer of the commission and what duty you were required
to perform in connection with this problem. First, let me ask you if
you reside here in the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are a consulting sanitary engineer, practicing
here in the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How long have you been engaged in the actual practice
of your profession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I graduated from the University of Michigan in
1893 and have been engaged in engineering work ever since. About
a year and a half ago Mr. Fenkell, the commissioner of public works
for the city of Detroit referred to me three problems to be reported
upon.</p>

<p>The first problem was that I review the data and conclusions of
the international joint commission for the purpose of enlarging on
any phase of the matter that might be necessary in order to determine
what preventive or remedial measures are required with reference to
Canadian waters.</p>

<p>The second problem was, to what extent does the sewage of the
city of Detroit pollute American waters so as to render them unfit
as a source of raw water for filtration purposes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The third problem submitted was, by what means, if any, should
the city of Detroit undertake to purify the sewage, and what expense
would be justifiable for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That was in November, 1914, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Since that time have you been engaged in working
out these problems for the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. During that time was the sanitary consulting engineer
of the commission engaged in the study of the same problems
here in the city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. During a portion of that time he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And you worked in conjunction with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Through the cooperation of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps and Mr.
McRae, who was in charge of the Detroit station, we engaged joint
offices for the study of what to me was the third problem submitted.
The cooperation was very close in working out the details connected
with the third problem submitted to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. That is as to remedial measures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir; by what means, if any, should the city of
Detroit undertake to purify the sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Since the report of the commission’s consulting sanitary
engineer has been made have you had an opportunity to examine
and study it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I have examined it; I have not studied it closely in
all its details.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have made a final report to the city council
of Detroit as a result of your investigation and study?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir; a copy of which report I have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. So far as the remedies for the pollution of the
Detroit River as it extends beyond the boundary are concerned, do
you know to what extent your report corresponds with the report
of the consulting sanitary engineer of the commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. In working out the problem jointly we came to a
practical agreement in the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are familiar with the alternative propositions
which the consulting sanitary engineer has submitted to the commission,
are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes, sir; entirely so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. There are six alternative measures referred to.
Our consulting engineer has expressed a preference for two of those
measures. Did you agree practically with his choice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes; we were practically agreed as to the methods
that were most desirable and most fitted for the conditions that exist
at Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You also agree with the consulting engineer of the
commission with respect to the Detroit metropolitan drainage district;
that is, taking in the suburban villages around here, as I understand
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I think that such a plan, if it could be consummated,
would be desirable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Two main reasons that are given for the consolidation
of this area into one drainage district are, first, preventing disputes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
between the various communities, and, second, effecting economies
and producing more satisfactory conditions generally by means
of comprehensive planning. Your studies were made along the line
of a metropolitan district such as is described here in this report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. They do not depend on that entirely for their
carrying out. The success of the scheme for purifying or treating
the sewage should not depend solely upon the establishment of a
metropolitan district.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It could be worked out as an independent system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. It could be done so, although it would be an advantage
to have it worked out as a metropolitan district. I might
say, in connection with that, probably an easier and more feasible
way of working that out would be by annexation by Detroit of
territory that immediately needs development, and that would not
require the machinery or legislation that the other scheme would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Are there many outlying districts which would
have to be annexed to the city of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. No; there are not many; if a working basis could
be arranged between the existing municipalities as has already been
done through the courts in the case of Highland Park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. In your report to the city council, Mr. Hubbell, do
you recommend the same standards of purification recommended by
the consulting engineers of the commission, both as to sewage and
water, or do you treat the standards at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I have gone into some detail in regard to the 500 B.
coli standard, and I believe it to be conservative and reasonable as
borne out by data and facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Did you go into the matter of standard of purification
of sewage or treatment of sewage, to what extent it should be
purified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. In a general way only. Accepting the 500 B. coli
standard, the indications are that approximately 90 to 95 per cent
purification would be needed bacterially to our sewage to meet that
standard. That, however, is a question for the future to determine.
It is, in my opinion, a little doubtful as to just what percentage of
bacterial removal would be required in order to produce that result,
but from my studies I concluded that from 90 to 95 per cent
would be required.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. And could be realized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. Yes; and could be realized; there is no question
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I gathered the impression from your report, by a
hasty glance at it, that while you did not quarrel with the standard
of 500 B. coli per 100 cubic centimeters you inclined rather to a more
severe standard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbard</span>. Well, that question is involved with the one of
seasonal variation. I made quite extensive studies to determine the
seasonal variations in the Detroit River independent of the data that
was shown in the International Joint Commission’s first report. I
found that for normal conditions in the Detroit River the number
of B. coli present was, perhaps, two and a fourth times the average
in the summer time, and about one-quarter of the average in the cold
months, following approximately the temperature curve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. To what condition do you attribute that increase in
the summer? In your judgment, has navigation anything to do
with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. In my judgment, the navigation has very little to
do with it, because the curve falls before navigation stops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the crisis in the curve—in what month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. June, July, August, and September are the high
months. The highest point of the curve which I determined for the
entire river was in September, but for the waterworks’ intake it was
in August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is it possible to explain why pollution is higher in
the summer months than in the winter months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I have made no attempt to explain that. I merely
report the fact that it is so on the Detroit River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I gather that that is a fact which can not be
questioned, but is not so easily explained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I concur in that expression; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. If I understand you correctly, then, Mr. Hubbell,
your recommendations to the city on this subject are practically in
accord with the recommendations of the consulting engineer of the
commission as to the remedies for the existing pollution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. We reached the same conclusion as to the method to
be adopted, if any is adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I think, Mr. Chairman, that we ought to have Mr.
Hubbell’s report made a part of the hearings for the purpose of using
such portions of it in the proceedings as the commission may hereafter
desire.</p>

<p>(The report of Mr. Hubbell was received as a part of his statement
before the commission on the question under consideration.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there anything further, Mr. Hubbell, that you
desire to present to the commission on this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubbell</span>. I have expressed myself fully in my report, and
there is nothing further, unless there are some questions that you
wish to ask me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I think your report is an admirable one and does you
great credit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Will the comptroller of the city of Detroit kindly
state for the record the assessed value of the property of the city
and the present bonded indebtedness?</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. GEORGE ENGEL,<br>COMPTROLLER OF THE CITY
OF DETROIT.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Engel</span>. I had rather have about 15 minutes for the purpose of
preparing such a statement and submit it to you in writing. Our
gross debt at this time is about $20,000,000 in round figures; the net
debt about $12,000,000. Our limitation is 4 per cent, and the assessed
valuation something over $700,000,000. So you see we have a leeway,
of something over $16,000,000. Our net debt is very small, probably
smaller than that of any city of its size in the United States. I will
have a statement prepared for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. We will incorporate your statement in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Do you mean the assessed value of real estate or the
combined real and personal valuation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Engel</span>. Combined real and personal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And the limitation applies to the combined valuation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Engel</span>. Yes, sir; and that is 4 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you any rule that you observe in respect to
valuation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Engel</span>. We are supposed to assess at cash value, full value,
100 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The market value?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Engel</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Engel</span>. About $18.50 per thousand for next year.</p>

<p>(Mr. Engel later submitted to the commission a statement of the
bonded debt of the city of Detroit, which is copied into the record
in full, as follows:)</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF T. CHALKLEY HATTON,<br>OF MILWAUKEE.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are here on the invitation of the commission,
and the invitation was extended to you because of your experience in
the matter of sewage treatment in the city of Milwaukee and also
because of the efficiency with which we are advised your plant is
being operated. Give such information to the commission as you
are prepared to give us concerning the method you have in use there,
and also as to its efficiency and operation. We will be very glad to
have you give us any opinion, based on your knowledge and experience,
that you care to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. It may be that I can best describe this process and
the results we are getting from it by giving you the situation in Milwaukee,
which is somewhat, as I take it, comparable with some of the
situations here. We discharge the crude sewage from the city of
Milwaukee into three rivers, from whence it flows into Lake Michigan,
and 3½ miles away from the harbor entrance we take our water
supply, in a depth of 50 feet. At the present time the water supply
is being partially or entirely sterilized by the use of liquid chlorine.
There is at the present time about an average of sixty millions of
sewage per day being discharged into Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Sixty million gallons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; and during this time the lake for an area of
about 25 square miles has become polluted, B. coli being retained in
that entire surface of the lake; and at all times we find the presence
of B. coli at the intake of our water supply, but the treatment of
liquid chlorine has, with one exception, enabled us to sterilize the
water with about twenty-eight hundredths to thirty hundredths
part of liquid chlorine. Last February we got a little larger quantity
of B. coli than usual because of four or five days of southeastern
storm, and in spite of the fact that we put all the liquid chlorine in
and more than the water would absorb, we got a typhoid-fever
epidemic in three or four weeks of about two hundred and some odd
cases. Now, that is the situation in Milwaukee, and for the
<span class="lock">purposes——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Before you pass on, you say 25 square miles has become
polluted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How far into the lake would the pollution extend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. About 5 miles; 3 miles on either side of the harbor
and 5 miles from the shore. The city is located on Milwaukee Bay,
which is a long crescent, about 10 miles from point to point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How far from the outlet of the sewer to the intake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Three miles and a half; and in addition to that, there
is a breakwater, which is supposed to partially prevent the water
from flowing from the harbor toward the intake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You pursued your investigations beyond the 5 or
6 miles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Whipple was employed to do that, and
he did it very thoroughly for many more miles than 25 square miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Did he discover traces of it farther than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; even farther than that; traces of it 6 miles away
to the north of the intake, but faint traces. It was a question with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
us, when the matter of sewage disposal came before us, of not only
treating the sewage so that the water could be properly treated by
filtration or chlorination subsequently, but it was also a question of
getting rid of the sludge from any sewage-disposal treatment which
we might put in, because there was no waste ground in the vicinity of
Milwaukee upon which sludge could be disposed of, and the consensus
of opinion of the citizens of Milwaukee was that the sludge should not
be deposited in the lake, no matter how far out. The feeling was very
strong. I might say, in introducing that matter, that in 1910 a board
of consulting engineers advised that disposition of the sludge, and
that feeling had been growing in the minds of the citizens for three
or four years before I went there, until it had assumed the attitude
that it would not be public policy to discharge the sludge into the
lake, no matter how far out, partially due to the large amount of
shipping which is and was expected to come into the harbors of Milwaukee,
and also from the fact that ships did take their water supply
from that lake before entering the city; so that it was a matter of
taking care of our <span class="lock">sludge——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Before you pass to that, how does the current compare
with the current in the other Lakes? There is less current in
Michigan Lake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes. The currents are influenced particularly by
the winds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is very little setting of the water out toward
the strait?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Very little. The general idea has been advanced, by
those who have studied the matter, that the water passes south on the
west side of the lake and to the north on the east side of the lake,
requiring approximately 10 years to make the entire circuit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is there any continuous flow out of the lake, or does
it flow in, on account of evaporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I think there is a flow out of the lake. I think the
record was taken some 12 or 14 years by the United States engineer at
that time, and he printed quite an elaborate report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Through the straits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; but just what that report contains I am not
familiar enough with it to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The flow is always out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I have an idea that the water works inward sometimes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, it comes down, as I say, on the west side, passes
round Chicago, and comes up on the east side, and passes out in the
straits; at least, that is my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I may be wrong, but I had an idea that the current
moved inward sometimes, and sometimes outward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, possibly so. This is the general tendency of
it, but I think it does sometimes pass out and in, according to the direction
of the winds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The Chicago Drainage Canal is not equal, I suppose,
to the inflows from the surrounding country. It does not balance it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, I think not. It is claimed here very recently
that the waters taken from the Chicago Drainage Canal have lowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the waters in the connecting streams some 5 or 6 inches. How
true that is I am not prepared to say. Now, before deciding upon
the method of sewage disposal for Milwaukee we built rather an
elaborate experimental station, in which we tried to put all those
modern methods of sewage disposal now prevalent in this country
and abroad, and I think we had 23 different processes going on there
at one time—one of the largest experimental stations carried on in
this country for sewage disposal purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. When was it established?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. In the middle of 1914. We have been operating it
just about two years. We tried out in that experimental station the
Imhoff tank, so-called settling tank, sprinkling filters, colloidal tanks,
electrolytic processes, chemical precipitation, chlorination, and finally,
what we called the activated sludge process, which we have been
trying out now for a year this month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Where did that process originate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, that is a question. Mr. H. W. Clarke, of the
Lawrence experimental station of Massachusetts, claims he discovered
it. Dr. Gilbert J. Fowler, of Manchester, England, now of
India, has assumed the discovery of it and developed it in a laboratory
way perhaps further than anybody else up to the time we took
care of it in Milwaukee. He started his experiments in 1914, or late
in 1913, and we started our experiments in 1914, late in 1914. But
it has been developed in Milwaukee to a greater extent than anywhere
else, either in Europe or United States. We started with a laboratory
investigation. From thence we went to tanks, holding or treating
70,000 gallons a day each, and from thence we have gone to tanks
treating 1,600,000 gallons a day, which are now being operated and
have been operated since last January. The process, stated briefly,
consists of, first, coarse screening the sewage, running it through
coarse screens, then into tanks of any depth to suit the conditions and
the situation, say from 10 to 20 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is the residue after the first screening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is the raw sewage after it has been coarse
screened. Then the raw sewage is run into these tanks, which have
in the bottom some method of diffusing air which is discharged into
the bottom of the tank at low pressure, just sufficient pressure to
keep the liquor agitated; while in there this liquor passes through
this tank, taking a certain time in accordance with the standard of
purification required, from two hours to four hours, during which
time it is being agitated and aerated by the air. From these tanks it
passes into a sedimentation tank. All of these tanks are practically
one tank divided by a wall separating the aerating tanks from the
sedimentation tank. After settling in the sedimentation tank from
45 minutes to an hour, or an hour and a half, according to the
character of the effluent you require, it then passes out into the
point of final discharge. The sludge which settles out of the liquor
into the sedimentation tank is then pumped back and discharged
into the raw sewage as it enters, or while passing into the beginning
of the aerating tank. The surplus sludge which settles in the sedimentation
tanks is treated otherwise, which I will describe later.
The process is one of aeration and nitrification practically. The
sewage does absorb a great deal of oxygen from the air which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
forced into it through these diffusing methods. The sludge, however,
which we return and keep intimately mixed with the sewage
at all times is perhaps the chief medium of purification, because
that sludge is filled with microorganisms and nitrifying organisms,
which really do the purification work, and that is the reason that it is
called activated sludge, because it is so filled with the nitrifying organisms,
and the more active the sludge is the more rapid and higher
degrees of purification you secure. It is a natural process entirely,
simply intensified by artificial means. To show you the activity of
that sludge, we got the raw sewage, perhaps a million bacteria per
cubic centimeter, in the first aerating tank, within half an hour; the
sludge contains anywhere from fifteen to twenty million bacteria
per cubic centimeter. In this sludge we give the bacteria the natural
environments for their work. We give them food, lodging, and air,
and that is just exactly what aerobic bacteria need, and the desire
is to have intensified the aerobic bacteria, which we have at all times
when the plant is being properly operated. Now, that is a brief
description of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is the only purpose of aeration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; there is another purpose of aeration, and that
is the intimate mixture of the sludge with the liquor. That can be
done mechanically with a little bit of air put in; but to do it mechanically
would increase undoubtedly the cost and the operating
expenses. In order to clarify the liquor it is not only necessary to
nitrify it, but it is necessary, as we call it, to scrub it, and we remove
the colloidal matter by means largely of scrubbing. To describe that
in a layman’s way, not in a chemical way, the colloidal matter in sewage
rests in the interstices between the globules of water, like water
rests in the interstices of the sand at the seashore. Now, if you disturb
that sand on the seashore, the water runs out and the sand becomes
free of it. If you scrub the globules of water together violently,
the colloidal matter is detached from the water and the water
becomes clear. That is as near a layman’s description as I can give
you, and we have tried the experiment out in our experimental station,
to see whether there is any odor in that sewage, and we have
thought that there is to a certain extent, not altogether. Now,
the question as to how to dispose of this sludge is one of the greatest
problems in sewage disposal in the world; and I think if any of
you went over to Toronto, which I had the pleasure of visiting three
weeks ago, you would see the difficulty that Toronto is up against in
getting rid of its sludge, as are all other cities in the United States,
whether it be Detroit or Buffalo, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, or New
York—well, I will not say New York and Philadelphia, because they
are out at the ocean, and they have a chance to get rid of it, but
inland cities will have this difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. They are taking it up in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; they may be able to discharge the sludge in the
sea, but inland cities on the Great Lakes or rivers are going to be
up against the proposition as to how to get rid of the sludge. Then
any method of sewage disposal which will enable the cities to get rid
of the sludge, whether it be at a profit, or whether it be to break
even, or whether it be at a loss, and yet to get rid of it to the advantage
of the agricultural element of this country and indirectly
to ourselves, will be that system of sewage disposal which will undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
meet the conditions of the large cities. That is the proposition
which is primarily confronting us in Milwaukee, as I started
out to say, and in all of this investigation there has been no doubt
evinced in the last three months by the leading consulting sanitary
engineers in the United States who have visited our plant that the
purification of the sewage has been solved within reasonable cost, but
there has been a great deal of doubt in their minds that the disposition
of the sludge has been solved, and I have told them that
within 90 <span class="lock">days——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Did you say that there was a feeling that the
problem had not been solved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. They felt that the question of the disposal of the
sludge had not been solved, although we had solved the question of
the disposal of the sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. They all recognized that the purification of the
sewage could be accomplished?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. They all recognized that the purification of the sewage
could be accomplished in that method at a reasonable cost. But
now we have solved practically the question as to the disposal of the
sludge. It is true we have not reached those definite figures of cost
which are necessary to convince the average municipal officer, but we
are proceeding very rapidly, and we have our own figures which we
feel are perfectly safe. In March for 10 days we dewatered this
sludge by compressing. Now, for two weeks we have dewatered the
sludge, and are drying the sludge, and reducing it into the form of a
fertilizer of low grade, which is marketable anywhere in Chicago,
and marketable along the eastern coast, through the chemical company—I
forget the name of the chemical company there, but it is the
largest fertilizing company in that district. They have offered us a
yearly contract for all the sludge of the character that we have submitted
to them that we could produce, based on the market value of
the ammoniacal nitrogen contained in the sludge, the potash, and the
available phosphoric acid. We have been testing this sludge day by
day for two weeks, and we have averaged from that sludge 5 per
cent of ammoniacal nitrogen—about sixty-seven one-hundredths per
cent is available of phosphoric acid, and nine-tenths of 1 per cent of
potash. Altogether that sludge is worth in the market, based on
those ingredients alone, $15 a ton. There is no doubt about reducing
it to a fertilizer basis. We have the apparatus and are doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you ever undertaken to extract anything else
from this sludge, such as oils?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We have, through the firm of Susenberger &amp; Sons, of
Chicago—no, it was a branch of Susenberger &amp; Sons, of Chicago,
which carries on the fertilizing end of the Susenberger &amp; Sons’ business.
They extracted the fats from the sludge, and turned the residue
into fertilizer. But we do not have more than 2 or 3 per cent fats
in our sewage, and that percentage of fats is not harmful to fertilizer,
and it does not pay to take it away from the sludge. Unless you get
at least 10 or 12 per cent of fat in your sludge, it does not pay to remove
it, as I am told by those who are in the business of manufacturing
fertilizers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you know that there is in operation in England
now a plant where they are extracting from the sludge gasoline and
lubricating oils and pitch?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, yes; I have read of it in a casual way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And nitrates, and carbolic acid; is that right, Mr.
Phelps?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I never go away without my box, and I want to show
you some samples which I have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You sell this stuff for $20 a ton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; $15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What does it cost to put it in a salable condition after
it is taken out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Six dollars a ton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You have a profit of $9 a ton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Approximately $9 a ton. You understand the ammoniacal
nitrogen varies, of course, and that cost is based upon the
ammoniacal nitrogen, and our average is 5 per cent so far. In wintertime
I imagine it will grow less. In July, August, and September it
will grow more. It is true we have a very strong sewage, containing,
for the last month, for instance, 369 parts of suspended matter.
That is a good deal stronger than the average municipal sewage. It
is industrial sewage, largely. Now, I do not want you to think these
samples I am showing you are picked out samples. These are samples
which a good many gentlemen present will tell you they have seen in
our plant that they have visited day by day. This was taken yesterday
at noon and delivered to me in the afternoon. This is a
bottle of the raw sewage, after passing through the half-inch screen.
I am now showing you a bottle of the sewage taken from the aerating
tanks, containing about 25 per cent of activated sludge, the nitrifying
media which purifies the sewage, and I am now showing you
the effluent passing away from the sedimentation tank 4 hours and
45 minutes after it passed into the influent tank. So far as we can
determine, there is a trace of suspended matter in that sewage. Of
course we could not determine whether it was stable or not, because
that takes time. It was taken out yesterday, but my chief chemist,
who brought the samples to me, told me there was no doubt about the
stability of that liquor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Have you analyzed it to determine whether there
subsists a certain amount of B. coli?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; this was taken yesterday; but we do get some
B. coli; we do not get complete sterilization. We attempt to get 95
per cent reduction of bacteria in our effluent. We have not had occasion
yet, except when our plant was broken down, or the lake was so
high that it backed into our plant, to reduce our standard. We could
always get 95 per cent, and we more often got 98 or 99 per cent. I
do not know whether I should show you this box I have here very
closely, because it does not smell very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You do not deodorize your sludge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No. I am showing you now a sample of the pressed
sludge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The reason I ask that is that I saw a sample of
pressed sludge recently, treated by the process I mention in operation
in England, where there was absolutely no odor to it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. There is no odor in this sludge until it has been out
in the air 24 hours. Then it begins to get very odorous. That is the
pressed sludge ready for the dryer. When that came out there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
no odor except an earthy odor. I am showing you now a sample of
the dried sludge ready for the fertilizer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is in ground form?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; that is not ground. That is just as it comes
out of the dryer. Some of it would have to be ground no doubt; we
are expecting to grind it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. The dried sludge has no smell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The dried sludge has no smell. There it is; it has
been on my desk for a good long while. We obtain about half a ton
of this dried sludge per 1,000,000 gallons of sewage treatment. It
means that we would get about $7.50 per 1,000,000 gallons out of
our sludge, and spend from $3 to $4 getting it out of the sewage,
making a profit of from $3 to $4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The process of sedimentation in that bottle has just
taken three minutes and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is where we were deceived in designing our
sedimentation tanks. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of finely
suspended matter, and it is that finely suspended matter which takes
the time to settle. But I want to draw your attention to the absence
of colloidal matter, and I want to say also that, outside of broad land
irrigation, or slow sand filtration, I think I am justified in saying
there is not any other method of sewage disposal process which will
so effectually take the colloidal matter out of sewage, and make the
sewage at least satisfactory, ethically, to all the cities and municipalities.
I am quite sure if you can discharge an effluent of that
kind in any of the rivers and waters between Canada and the United
States that no citizen of Canada or no citizen of America can possibly
object. He goes largely by what he sees, not by the ingredients
which some chemist tells him are in the water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any of the by-products you extract from
the sludge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We do not attempt to extract any by-products. We
propose to sell the sludge as a fertilizer in the shape I have shown to
you in this box. I might say that there is no other process of sewage
disposal at present in common use in America favorable to this locality
comparable with this process, except Imhoff tank and sprinkling
filters, followed by final sedimentation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is this process called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Activated sludge. We tried out the Imhoff tank
process with chlorination in this same sewage, and found the cost a
little bit less than the cost of this process, without finally disposing
of the sludge. We also tried out Imhoff tank, followed by sprinkling
filters, and found the cost much more than this process. We
also found, in our climate of Milwaukee, that, instead of averaging
two and a half million gallons, or getting two and a half million gallons
per acre per day through sprinkling filters in wintertime, there
were three months that we could not get more than a million and a
half. We also found that up to the present date we have not been
able to dry sludge in the open air coming from the Imhoff tank from
the first of last November up to the present day, and in making our
estimates, we do not believe we could get three months in the whole
year in this climate—I am speaking of Milwaukee—when we could
dry sludge effectually from the Imhoff tank or any other sedimentation
process. We have too much rain in June to dry sludge, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
only way we could possibly dry Imhoff tank sludge was by covering
with glass, heating the place, as suggested by a gentleman in Cleveland,
Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How long does the drying process last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, that is all according to the weather. If the
weather is very nice and warm, and we have the sun, and not too
damp, it will dry out in about two weeks; it will dry into a spadable
condition in five to six days in good dry weather, but if there is a
little bit of rain comes along overnight, or if it is alongside a lake,
and there is considerable moisture or damp, it may take two or three
days longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How do you dry the sludge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. In a drier, an industrial drier, just the same as they
use in the packing houses in Chicago and many of the breweries and
many other places throughout the United States in industrial works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Does it require much space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; the amount of land which we have laid out to
treat a hundred million gallons a day, which is the quantity we will
have to treat, is 20 acres; that is, including our pumping stations, our
ministration houses, sludge-disposal houses, and everything concerned.
In fact, to be distinct, this system can treat from ten to
twelve million gallons of sewage per acre per day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What does it cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The cost of the treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The installation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. About the same as the Imhoff tank. I say that
because we worked out the Imhoff tank layout, and also our activated
sludge layout, upon the same ground, and it broke even as to cost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. When you say you make a profit on the sludge, in
the disposal of it, what cost do you consider?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I did not catch that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. When you say you make a profit out of the disposal
of the sludge, what cost do you consider? The cost of the
<span class="lock">drying——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The cost of the drying, the cost of the dewatering,
the cost of the freight and the overhead charges of the machinery
necessary to dewater and to dry, and the attendance cost—all those
have to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You take the raw sewage that comes from the tank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We take the raw sewage as it comes from the sedimentation
tank containing 97 per cent of water and deal with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That all enters into cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. That is $6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Would you tell us the cost of the aeration in preparing
the sludge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That would be taken into account as against some
other system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I think I have that. I will read to you from a copy
of the Second Annual Report of the Sewage Commission of the City
of Milwaukee of 1915:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The cost of the activated sludge, continuous flow, with a removal of 95.5 per
cent bacteria—</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>I say that because the cost of the operation and the plant depends
entirely upon the character of effluents you want to secure. A lower
grade of effluents lowers the first cost and operating cost, so this is
based on a removal of 95.5 per cent, which is our <span class="lock">standard——</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The disposal of sludge in cost per million gallons, $3. The interest and
depreciation on the cost of the plant, based at 7½ per cent, $2.81. Cost of
operation, exclusive of sludge, $2, making a total cost of $7.81 per million
gallons treated.</p>
</div>

<p>From this $7.81 must be taken the value of the recoverable sludge,
which, as I stated to you, so far in our investigations has been $3
per million gallons, or making a total net cost of $4.81 per million
gallons, which includes overhead charges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What was the cost of your Milwaukee plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, we have a 1,600,000-gallon plant now. The
aggregate cost of our total plant is estimated to be about two and a
half million dollars—will be that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And that will take care <span class="lock">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. A hundred million gallons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is your population?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The present population, 450,000; we are building a
plant to provide for a population of 800,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is the per capita cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I have not worked it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Does the cost decrease relatively in larger plants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Quite so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It is not adding simply a unit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No. Of course, the cost of this plant largely depends
upon the cost of the air. The larger the air plant the less
the cost of air. We figure our cost of air based upon a cost of
electricity of seventy-seven one-hundredths per cent per kilowatt
hour, which is the rate fixed by the Wisconsin Railway Commission
for that sort of power; so that that rate is actually fixed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is that power quite an item in the cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Quite an item; the biggest item in the cost; the cost
of power for compressing the air—that and the overhead charges,
such as the interest on the money invested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Are you aware whether power is more expensive
in Milwaukee than in Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I am not; I do not know what the cost of power is
in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. About what is the cost of horsepower? What is the
cost to you people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I say it costs us seventy-seven one-hundredths of a
cent per kilowatt hour, and horsepower is about three-quarters of a
kilowatt in round numbers—six-tenths of a cent, I should say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is there any nuisance resulting from the drying
process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No. The gases must be washed, and then after passing
through the washer are taken into the plant itself—into the
liquor, and the liquor is a deodorizer; so there is no odor arises from
the cooking of the sludge, as we call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. That is the drying of the sludge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, that is what we call cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. This is not the same principle of the two tanks where
the material is taken into one tank and has a certain bacterial operation,
and then passes into another tank, and then finally into beds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You know the system to which I refer; they had it in
England in one place, and then started it in Canada, and it was not
a success?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is, they passed from aerating <span class="lock">beds——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. No; they passed first into an inclosed chamber, where
the bacteria destroyed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I should imagine, from what you say, that must be
the process by which both the aerobic and the anaerobic bacteria are
the destroyers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We do not want any anaerobic bacteria in our process,
because it produces septic action, which is inimical to our process, because
it absorbs the oxygen and interferes with the efficiency of the
process.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Can you take the sludge from the Imhoff tank and
use it, or treat it the same as you are treating the sludge there in Milwaukee
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We can; but the trouble is that the sludge from the
Imhoff tank, as we have found it in Milwaukee, only contains about
from 1 to 1½ per cent of ammoniacal nitrogen at most, and that does
not pay for its recovery. I want to say another thing about this
which is of interest. There is no odor about the operation of the plant
at all. You can stand over one of the tanks as it is being aerated and
have no odor come to you, or no odor throughout the entire plant,
unless you let the sludge stay undried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. To what do you attribute the lower percentage in the
sludge taken from the Imhoff tanks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The fermentation process removes the ammonias from
the sludge. Well, practically all the reduction of the sludge in the
Imhoff tank proposition is the fermentation process, and of course
that removes a large portion of fertilizer values in the sludge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Are there any weak features in this process that you
look forward to correcting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. There are some problems which we are investigating,
with a view of getting a more economical use of the air, and thus a
lower cost of operation, and that problem concerns the diffusion of
the air in the tanks. We are trying out three methods of diffusion.
We are not prepared to say yet which is the most economical. I am
giving you the figures based upon that which we have used, and our
whole efforts now are being directed to reducing the amount of air
used. That is the principal point which we are investigating at the
present time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How does the operating cost of your system compare
with the operating cost of the Imhoff tanks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The operating cost of the Imhoff tank is considerably
less than the operating cost of our tanks. They have no air to pay
for, and very little plant attendance to pay for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. As I understand you, the cost to the municipality
under your system is less than the cost under the other system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The cost of the Imhoff tank, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is true of installations of any magnitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Installation, but not operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. On both—that is, taking into consideration the value
of the sludge recovered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Your system costs the municipality less than the
other system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Providing they sell the sludge. I want to make it
plain to you gentlemen that I am not giving you this information
as it may pertain to Detroit or Buffalo or any other city, but as it
concerns Milwaukee, because I am not in a position to speak of it
here, not knowing your situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You state that you recently had your plant examined
by a number of the leading consulting sanitary engineers of the
country, and that while they all agreed that your system was successful,
so far as purification of sewage was concerned, they expressed
doubt as to the disposing of the sludge. On what do they base their
skepticism or doubt with reference to the sludge disposal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Past experience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Your past experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; past experience of the sanitary engineers who
have expressed that doubt. As I started to say, or I think I did say
at the beginning of my remarks, that disposition of the sludge was
the greatest problem, both in Europe and America, and this was so
easy, apparently, to dispose of, that they were from Missouri and
had to be shown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. After seeing the way in which you disposed of sludge
in Milwaukee plant, did that satisfy them or remove their doubts as
to the efficiency of your method?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. They have not seen it yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I thought you said they personally visited it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. They have personally visited it. We put it in operation,
but our press broke down. We have only put this portion of it
in operation in the last two weeks, and it is only now we have begun
to dry it; we did not have a dryer before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Do you use the rotary dryer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. The rotary direct dryer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I interrupted you when you were about to say that
in 90 days you would demonstrate something, and you stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I told these engineers that in 90 days I would demonstrate
the possibilities of disposing of the sludge, but I have already
demonstrated it before the end of the 90 days. I think I said that at
Syracuse some time ago in an address I delivered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. In an address made, I think, in 1915 you expressed
some doubt as to the efficacy of your method in winter months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; I did; and in order to try out this system in
Milwaukee during the winter months was the purpose of building
this 1,600,000-gallon plant which we are now operating; that was the
primary object of building that plant, which cost us $65,000, and we
got it in operation the first week in January and we have operated it
since continuously with temperatures as low as 20° below zero, with
a clear effluent during the cold winter months coming out of the
plant as that effluent which you see there in that bottle. We had no
freezing and no trouble with ice. We had, of course, much lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
nitrates in our effluent than we had in the summer months; in fact,
we had very little nitrates, but we kept up the stability about 104 to
110 hours’ average; some of them went up higher. We go on the
basis of 5 days’ stability test instead of 10 days. The American
Public Health Association suggest that five days is all we need.</p>

<p>You ask me about the relative cost of the Imhoff tank installation
and operating as compared with the activated sludge. Our investigations
in Milwaukee show that the cost of the Imhoff tank, without
sterilization, is $6.20 per million gallons—that includes all overhead
charges—as against $7.81 for the activated sludge. The cost of the
Imhoff <span class="lock">tank——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is that an estimated or actual cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is the cost from the operation of our plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Actual operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Actual operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is it not an estimated cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No. The cost of the Imhoff tank with sterilization,
reducing the bacteria 85 per cent, was $9.51 per million gallons, as
against $7.81 for the activated sludge. Mark you, the bacterial removal
in the activated sludge was 95.5 per cent for that cost, whereas
the bacterial removal in the Imhoff with chlorination was 85 per
cent; and we attempted—and the report is in here—to sterilize our
Imhoff tank effluent to that point comparable with the activated
sludge, and found that the cost of the process was about $14.50 per
million gallons.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. How much chlorine does that represent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Eight and five-tenths parts, which costs $5 per million
gallons, based on 7 cents per pound; that is 3 cents per pound
less than we were paying for it; and we believed—in fact, we were
assured—that if we bought it by carload lots we could get it for 7
cents per pound at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Now, circumstanced or conditioned as Milwaukee is,
how does the cost of disposing of your sewage, as at present carried
on, compare with what it would be if you dumped it in its raw
state into the lake, that is taking the raw sewage when it comes
from the end of the sewage pipe? Is Milwaukee the gainer or the
loser by disposing of the sewage as you suggest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, undoubtedly the gainer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is, by treating the sewage as you treat it, and
disposing of the product, the fertilizer, Milwaukee is the gainer, as
against dumping it in its raw condition into the lake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Decidedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is something consequential.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Financially, it is disposing of the sewage at a profit,
as I understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Oh, no; I do not want you to think that. We do
not get enough profit out of our sludge to pay for the treatment of
the sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is the inference I drew from your answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What you say is that it pays to dispose of the
sludge after the treatment process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; there is a profit in it, but not sufficient to pay
for the whole cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. When the sludge has been treated you calculate
the cost of drying it and disposing of it, and you make a profit out
of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Take a million gallons of sewage at the point of delivery
here in Detroit, and assume Detroit to be circumstanced or
conditioned just the same as Milwaukee is from a sewage standpoint,
what would it cost to bring that sewage up to the point at which
you take it for the purpose of manufacturing into fertilizer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. It costs $7.81 per million gallons, and we get therefrom
practically $3. I am taking the lowest estimate now, making
a cost of $4.81 for the treatment of sewage. I think that answers
the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. For 1,000,000 gallons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; per million gallons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Where does the $3 come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. It is the profit from the sludge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Deducting the cost of treating it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The actual cost is $4.81.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Following up the question Mr. Magrath asked you,
to anticipate any necessary outlays you made for improvements,
without regard to this, taking the machinery as it is to-day, is there
anything that you think would come in to disturb these features and
upset them in the present conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. As to the process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Nothing that has been discovered so far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You do not anticipate anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Nothing at all; if I did, sir, I would hardly be warranted
in recommending to my board the expenditure of two and
a half millions for this process. That is the best way to answer that.
We have adopted this process, and are going ahead to build it as soon
as we get our land, which has to be condemned partially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Before you leave the subject, many municipalities,
as you know, dump crude sewage into flowing water, and consequently
they have not arranged their collecting sewers at any particular
point. In the application of this system of yours is it necessary
that there should be a collection of the sewage at some particular
point, or could it be applied quickly to those existing municipalities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is one of the features about the process. While
it is always desirable to get one point to dispose of your sewage, where
the cost is considerable for intercepting sewers to get at that one
point it is better to divide up those numbers of points, providing you
can do so without nuisance and at less cost than the intercepting
sewers, and with this process it can be built and operated in the
heart of the city without any nuisance arising. I think that answers
the question, does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is there any difference in that respect between your
treatment and the Imhoff tank treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I think not. There is no odor that is objectionable
about an Imhoff tank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I mean as to the necessity of intercepting sewers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I think not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. In either case, the question of intercepting sewers
is a question to be considered, according to the layout of the ground?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; not altogether that; according to the layout
of the ground and according to the process which you propose. If,
for instance, you should go beyond the Imhoff tank process and put
in sprinkling filters or nitrifying beds, then you would have to get
outside of the city, in order to prevent the nuisance arising from those
beds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Perhaps I did not make my meaning clear. Is
there any advantage in your system as to the multiplying of the treatment
works, in order to avoid the construction of intercepting sewers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Between the two works?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; I think not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Your process is not affected by atmospheric conditions
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; except <span class="lock">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Except extreme cold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes. We have to use more air in the cold weather
than we do in the warm weather, in order to get the same quality of
effluent, approximately this winter 12 per cent more air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It means practically 12 per cent additional cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Of the air alone; but this cost I have quoted is the
actual cost of summer and winter conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fenkell</span>. May I ask a question? To what extent would it be
necessary to allow untreated water to escape because of rainstorm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We are anticipating at the present time, or will
anticipate in this plant, 150 gallons of rain water per capita; that is
all the rain water that will be carried to the plant, and that rain
water will be treated the same as the dry-weather flow. The balance
of the rain water will go into the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is per diem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Per capita; 150 gallons per capita per day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dow</span>. May I ask the witness whether I am correct in my
summing up of the advantage of his method over the Imhoff tank
method, in that it tends to reduce the net cost by producing a readily
marketable fertilizer; that is the essential advantage. Am I correct
in so understanding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Not altogether, sir. As far as your statement goes,
it is correct, but to get a removal of 95 per cent of bacteria from the
raw sewage, it costs considerably more to do it by the Imhoff tank
and sterilization than it does by this process. I just quoted the
figures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dow</span>. Then initially, the advantage is that, with equal operating
costs a higher removal of bacteria is possible by this process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dow</span>. And in addition thereto, there is a certain commercial
advantage, in that the product is readily marketable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dow</span>. Much more readily marketed than the Imhoff product?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; that is true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dow</span>. As regards the latter phase of the situation, am I correct
also in my supposition that the present prices for fertilizers are
abnormal, having regard to the prices prior to the war, say 1914?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No; the price of two and a half per unit is the price
that existed prior to the war; the price of ammoniacal nitrogen to-day
is considerably higher than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dow</span>. The figures given are based upon what might be considered
normal markets, and not upon the present very abnormal
prices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; for instance, phosphoric acid is worth to-day
10 times as much as the quotations I have used in making my valuations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any questions, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps?</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Just one point that Mr. Mignault brought out.
Comparing the results of your process with the Imhoff tank, Mr.
Mignault rather concluded that the Imhoff tank could be used in the
same location as your plant. Is it not true that the effluents from
the two types of treatment compare as the two samples on the table,
activated sludge effluent being clear, and that from the Imhoff
tank turbid and discolored, similar to raw sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. That is true. I answered that with the idea of
nuisance to the adjacent neighbor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. What is your actual saving, as you actually contemplate
placing interceptors, collecting the sewage, in the adoption of
your method?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. We are saving about $2,000,000 in carrying out the
subaqueous tunnel a mile and a half out to sea, as the original board
of engineers suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I understood you to give that as the esthetic feature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Yes; not only esthetic feature, but the purification
feature; in other words, the local engineer has indicated that he
would not permit, with his sanction, any sewage disposal plant
which would deposit that much suspended matter in the harbor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. The question I put to you was to ascertain, in
case they decided to establish other treatment plants in order to avoid
constructing sewers, whether your system had any advantage over
the Imhoff-tank system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. As I answered your question before, I was looking
upon it with a view to nuisance to the neighborhood. As to nuisance
which might arise from the discoloration of the water, I should say
the Imhoff tank would be far more deleterious in that respect than
our process; but as to nuisances arising in the waters due to decomposition,
assuming that the sterilization of the Imhoff tank liquor
is complete, then the two plants would be practically equal, as to
nuisances arising outside of the discoloration of the water.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. In regard to the matter which Mr. Mignault has
brought out, I think it should be stated that, as far as the city of
Detroit is concerned, and also as far as Buffalo is concerned, the
question of interceptors, or of local plant, was not determined by the
character of the treatment, but was determined solely by the physical
conditions—that is, it was impossible for us to locate the local plants
and thus save the interceptors, by reason of the levels of the sewers
and the inaccessibility of available land. We did consider local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
treatment, and if it had been feasible it would have represented
considerable saving. The determination is not conditioned by the
character of the treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you anything further to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. On behalf of the commission, I desire to extend to
you our sincere thanks for your appearing before us, coming from
Milwaukee for that purpose, and giving us the very interesting and
clear statement you have concerning the operation of your plant in
Milwaukee and the process of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. We can all assent to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Without any question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You refer to the published report of the city of
Milwaukee. Is that available?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. I would be glad to give it to the commission. I am
sorry to say it is the last one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is the only one you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Except our own office copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. And the process is described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Quite well; and the results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I suppose it is impossible to get copies of this any
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hatton</span>. Well, there are some of them in public laboratories
throughout the country and among engineers; but we had a pretty
lively demand for them and we only had 500 copies issued, and they
are all gone. That is a copy I picked up on my desk yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have a brief statement here regarding
lake currents which would elucidate what Mr. Hatton was not quite
familiar with.</p>

<p>Mr. Goddard, assistant engineer at Grand Rapids of the United
States engineer office, read a paper before the Engineers’ Club, of
Grand Rapids in April, 1916, which included his own experience, as
well as a compilation of the results of the studies of others and covering
a number of years. His conclusions were that the currents in the
Lakes are produced primarily by the winds and secondarily by variation
in barometric pressure.</p>

<p>Wind currents follow the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Pressure currents flow from high to low pressure areas.</p>

<p>The flow through the Straits of Mackinac in either way, according
as the above conditions prevail.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. THEODORE A. LEISEN,<br>GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT
OF THE WATERWORKS OF THE CITY OF DETROIT.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Leisen, you are the president of the Great Lakes
Pure Water Association, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are you connected with that association?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. I have a letter from the secretary asking me to represent
the association at this meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you examined this report of the consulting
engineer of the commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. I regret to say that I did not see that report until
yesterday at noon, and I think you can realize that I have not. While<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
I had endeavored to read over a part of it I have not been able to
digest it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What are the functions of your organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. The functions are largely the questions from the sanitary
point of view of preserving the purity of the waters of the Great
Lakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. It is a voluntary organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. It is a voluntary organization without any official
standing. It is simply an auxiliary to the health departments in an
unofficial way, I should say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Where are the headquarters located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Practically they have no headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Who are the officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Mr. Paul Hansom, of the Illinois State Board of
Health, is the secretary; and Dr. Charles J. Hastings is president.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Has your organization followed the work of the International
Joint Commission in this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. My familiarity with the organization is almost nil.
As I say, I had a conversation with Mr. Hansom in New York relative
to the matter a few weeks ago, and he asked me if I was still a
member of the association. As a matter of fact, that did not come to
a definite point until I got his letter asking me to represent them
here. Officially, I am not in a position to say very much about the
association or what they have done. It is a newly organized body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. When was it organized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Some time during the past years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What are its purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. I think the preservation of the purity of the waters
of the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And also the connecting rivers, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you any statement which you desire to make to
the commission in respect to the pollution of these waters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. As you understand, I am the general superintendent
for the board of water commissioners here in Detroit, and as such
have charge of the water supply. So, naturally, my interest from
that point of view would be <span class="lock">toward——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You appeared before the commission two years ago,
when we were here, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. And at that time you gave us full and detailed information
concerning the water purification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. I believe the points were generally covered then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you the same process now that you had at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. With this difference: At that, time we were treating
the water with hypochloride of lime as a disinfectant. We have since
changed to liquid chlorine treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What has been the result?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. There has been no radical difference in the result.
The results obtained from the use of hypochloride of lime have been
almost identical with those obtained from the use of liquid chlorine;
possibly some elimination of the taste in the water. I do not believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the complaints of taste of chlorine have been of any moment at all
since the liquid-chlorine process was adopted. To that extent I consider
it an improvement and it is a little more cleanly. It is a nicer
process, more methodical, and more mechanical in its methods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have only one intake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is its capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. It is 10 feet in diameter and a little over 300 feet long.
Its capacity, of course, would vary with the head permissible on the
shore end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How many gallons are you consuming per day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. We are consuming at the present time about 130,000,000
to 160,000,000 gallons per day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is, a day of 24 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Yes. Our highest hourly capacity for any one period
was at the rate of about 190,000,000 gallons per day of 24 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The hour consumption was at that rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. That was the peak load, yes; for one hour during the
past year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you studied this problem in connection with
the matter of sewage disposal at all, or do you deal entirely with the
water end of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. I have no official connection with the sewage disposal
proposition; but my interests are simply those of an engineer in the
problem, and as a citizen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you had any cases of typhoid fever in the city
of Detroit in the last year or two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leisen</span>. Yes; there have been cases, not abnormal. The typhoid-fever
death rate has been reasonably constant for the last few
years and comparatively low.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you gentlemen any questions to ask? If not,
that is all, Mr. Leisen. Are there any other gentlemen here representing
the city of Detroit who wish to be heard on this subject? I see
that the mayor of the city has just come in, in time to witness the
closing of these hearings. He may have something to say. If he has
we shall be glad to hear from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marx</span>. I do not know really what you have done this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Well, gentlemen, it seems that this closes the hearing.
In concluding the hearing I have been requested, on behalf of
the commission, to extend to the mayor of the city of Detroit and the
council of the city our sincere thanks for the courtesy which has been
extended to us in giving us the use of this council chamber. I can
assure the mayor and the council that the commission sincerely appreciates,
not only the courtesy that has been extended to us, but also
the hearty cooperation which we have received from the officials of
the city since the beginning of the investigation, and we sincerely
hope that when our final recommendations are made to the two Governments
they will receive the approval and support of the city of
Detroit and of the neighboring cities as well. Thanking you gentlemen
for your appearance and courtesy, I will state that the hearings
are now closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marx</span>. I want to assure you of our continued cooperation.</p>

<p>(Thereupon, at 12.30 o’clock p. m., the hearings were closed.)</p>

<span class="smcap r4">International Joint Commission,</span><br>
<span class="r2"><i>Ogdensburg, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, Friday, August 25, 1916.</i></span><br>
</p>

<p>The commission met at 10 o’clock a. m.</p>

<p>Mr. Gardner presided.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Gentlemen, you will kindly come to order. In August,
1912, the Governments of Canada and the United States jointly
referred to the International Joint Commission for investigation and
report, under the terms of Article IX of the treaty of January 11,
1909, certain questions relating to the pollution of boundary waters.
Briefly stated, these questions are: What are the extent, causes, and
localities of such pollution? How may such pollution best be
remedied?</p>

<p>It is safe to say that of all the questions with which the commission
has had to deal this is by far the most important. Nothing can
be more vital than the conservation of health, and that is precisely
the object of this investigation. The population directly tributary
to the boundary waters between Canada and the United States
amounts to over 7,000,000, and it is estimated that over 15,000,000
are carried annually in steamboats on these waters. The pollution
of boundary waters is a direct menace to every one of these millions
of citizens of the two countries. Its prevention will be of incalculable
benefit.</p>

<p>In investigating the first question the commission was fortunate
enough to secure the services of Dr. Allan J. McLaughlin, of the
United States Public Health Service, and now commissioner of
health of Massachusetts. Associated with him were Dr. J. W. S.
McCullough, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> John A. Amyot, and Mr. F. A. Dallyn, of the
Provincial Board of Health of Ontario. Under the direction of
these officers bacteriological surveys were carried out throughout the
boundary waters, from the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John River in the east to the Lake
of the Woods in the west. They also had the cordial cooperation of
the Public Health Services of both the Federal Governments and of
the States and Provinces on these boundary waters. The results of
this investigation were embodied in a progress report submitted to
the two Governments in 1914, to which was appended a very complete
report by the sanitary experts of the commission, outlining
the extent of pollution in the different localities and the causes to
which it was attributed.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the first question, the commission took up the
second, as to remedies. As a first step, a conference was arranged
in New York with six eminent sanitary engineers, George W. Fuller,
Earle B. Phelps, and George C. Whipple, of the United States, and
F. A. Dallyn, W. S. Lea, and Theo. J. Lafrenière, of Canada,
whose testimony furnishes an invaluable record on the engineering
side of the question. As a result of this conference certain broad
fundamental principles were established, upon which any remedial
action must be based. The services of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps were secured as
consulting sanitary engineer to the commission, and under his direction
a series of careful studies were made, with particular reference
to the interception and treatment of riparian sewage on the Detroit
and Niagara Rivers, the chief areas of pollution. Public hearings
were held in the cities and towns along these waters in 1914, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
again in the present year, to afford every opportunity to the municipal
and other authorities interested to put their views before
the commission.</p>

<p>In March, 1916, the consulting sanitary engineer submitted to the
commission his report upon remedial measures. Before closing the
hearings the commission deemed it desirable to give those interested
in health matters on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence an opportunity to come forward
and present their views. With that object in view it was decided
to hold a meeting in Ogdensburg to-day. Afterwards the
commission will proceed to prepare for submission to the two Governments
its final report, both as to the extent and causes of pollution
and as to the remedies best designed to safeguard the health of the
Canadian and American communities along the boundary.</p>

<p>Not only are we here to confer with those interested in health matters,
to find remedies for the removal of the causes of pollution, but
to ascertain to what extent and by what methods, system, or lack of
system are the boundary waters in this community being polluted in
contravention of the terms of the treaty made between the British
Empire and the United States, which provides that “These waters
shall not be polluted on either side of the line to the injury of health
or property on the other,” and also to serve notice that the time is
drawing near when no raw sewage will be allowed to flow into these
waters, and all communities in the near future will be required to
treat their sewage by some process of purification before being
allowed to use the waters of the boundary as an avenue for its discharge.
The commission therefore desires to hear from representatives
of the cities and towns bordering on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River as
to what is being done at this time and what plans, if any, are being
considered for the future to remove the causes of pollution in these
boundary waters.</p>

<p>By direction of the chairman, Secretary Burpee then read the
notice of the meeting to be held at Ogdensburg, which was sent to
interested municipalities and officials in the United States and
Canada, together with copies of the report of the consulting sanitary
engineer of the commission, and also the list of the municipalities to
whom the notice and report were sent.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. GEORGE A. WRIGHT,<br>
MAYOR OF BROCKVILLE, ONTARIO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I shall have very little
to say, personally. We have with us our city engineer and medical
health officer, who will be able to give you whatever information you
require and to ask for whatever information we ourselves desire. It
is needless to say that we are very much interested in this question.
Pure water has been a big problem with us in the town of Brockville.
Within a year we have suffered severely from impure water. Therefore
we are looking at the present time for ways and means to secure
a supply of pure water. We have been dealing with the question of
filtration, but the matter has not been definitely settled by us yet.</p>

<p>As to the disposal of our sewage, our civic officers will give you
information regarding that. I do not think it is necessary for me to
take up any more of your time than to introduce to you, first, our
medical health officer, Dr. Macauley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You obtain your water from the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River,
do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. We take our drinking water from the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River and discharge our sewage into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Do you discharge your sewage into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River treated or untreated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Untreated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You said that you had suffered severely from impure
water within the last year. Will you kindly state what your experience
was in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. We had a typhoid epidemic about a year ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How large an epidemic did you have in your town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. We had about 180 cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the population of Brockville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. About 10,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How many deaths were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Fourteen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Was that the first instance of typhoid that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. It was the first epidemic. We had a break in one of
our pipes, which I think had something to do with the cause of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Did you trace the source of the epidemic to the pollution
in the river water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the cause of your pollution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. We think the sewage is the cause.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Sewage from where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. From the town of Brockville. Of course, as I stated,
there was a break in our sewage pipe which permitted the contamination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is the source of your intake farther upstream?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. It is above our sewage outlet; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How far above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Not a great distance, but much farther out in the
river. The town engineer will be able to give you that information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. If your intake is farther upstream than the outlet of
the sewage, how can the sewage be responsible for the trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. We have a considerable eddy. On account of the
eddy in the river we occasionally find sewage above the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is the town’s own sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Yes. We find that the river there is contaminated,
and we find a great deal of difficulty in obtaining any samples of pure
water in the river anywhere in the neighborhood of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Are there many shoals in the river which cause a deflection
of the current?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Yes; there are a great many shoals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That leads to a mixture of the waters on both banks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is there any sewage in the river above Brockville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. There are some small summer resorts above the town,
and I understand that a limited amount of sewage goes in from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How far is it from Brockville to Gananoque?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. A little over 30 miles. We do not feel that we are
contaminated from Gananoque, though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I suppose you have never made an investigation to
see whether you are or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You would rather have those questions directed to
your health officer, would you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. I think so. I will ask our health officer, Dr.
Macauley, to take the floor now.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF DR. A. J. MACAULEY,<br>MEDICAL HEALTH OFFICER
OF BROCKVILLE, ONTARIO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your official position, Dr. Macauley?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I am medical health officer of Brockville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How long have you occupied that position?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. About 15 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What has been your observation in regard to the
water supply for the city of Brockville?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. The water supply, the untreated water, for years
has been found to be impure. It is much more impure now than it
was some years ago, but we have always found colon bacilli in the
water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. In your opinion, does it increase in amount as the
time goes on?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. It certainly has increased.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. To what do you attribute the increase?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I suppose it is the pollution. There is a constant
emptying of sewers into the water all the way up. As you will find
by investigation, the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River is polluted all the way up,
even above the towns where the summer resorts are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. There are a large number of boats that ply on
the river, are there not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. There are a great many boats; I could not say as
to the number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I suppose the islands and the riparian communities
are increasing in population, and the increase in sewage would
be the logical result?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you ever made any independent examinations?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>. Examinations have been made by our board. They
are made every week. I think from four to six samples a week are
analyzed, and the raw water is now found to be constantly polluted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you a water-filtration plant?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. We have not. We chlorinate our water by gas
chlorination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What would be the average summer contamination,
expressed in colon bacilli?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. We find colon bacilli practically constant in 5 to 10
cubic centimeters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you notice any difference in the amount of pollution
in winter and summer?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I think it is practically the same; perhaps it may
be a little higher in the summer season.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What have you done locally to remedy the situation,
Dr. Macauley?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Our epidemic was due to an accident. The intake
pipe we have now extends 700 feet out into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
from the dock, but the one we had before extended only a little
over 100 feet into the river. There is an eddy that flows down to
Picketts Point right below Brockville, and it goes right straight up
back along the shore; but our sewage pipe extends about 900 feet
down and about 800 feet from the shore. In December about two
years ago a boat anchor got a hold of the sewer pipe down below our
intake pipe and opened it about 200 feet from shore. It made an
opening in the joint of the pipe, and we got the pollution from the
sewage into the intake pipe. That is undoubtedly what caused the
epidemic. When that was remedied the epidemic stopped.</p>

<p>Our water is chlorinated. We use about 100 pounds of hypochloride
to 3,000,000 gallons of water. It is put in as an equivalent,
because we use gas instead of the chlorine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you more than one outlet to your sewage
discharge?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes; we have. We have an outlet at the western
end of the town. Our engineer will give you the capacity of that
outlet. Our main outlet is below the town and also below our intake
pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Your system of piping is a series of small pipes, is
it not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes; but there is a trunk sewer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How large are those pipes?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. The engineer can give you that information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Dr. Macauley, on which side of the river is the riparian
population increasing most rapidly, on the United States or
the Canadian side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I think it is increasing most rapidly on the Canadian
side; perhaps not in the summer resorts; there is quite a large
population on the islands, but principally on the American side.
The population is increasing very rapidly each year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. When you say on the Canadian side do you mean exclusive
of Brockville?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Well, they are increasing every year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. As rapidly as on the American side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I do not think so with respect to the summer resorts,
because the majority of the islands are on the American side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the density of the population during the
time that the summer residents are there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I could scarcely tell you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I want to get the floating population passing from
one side to the other.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I could not give you that information. There is a
great deal of pollution undoubtedly from the boats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. There is quite a large summer population on the
islands?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. There is, particularly this summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You do not make provision for letting the surface
water of the city pass into your sewerage system, do you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Partially it does; but it enters the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence by
a separate pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How many cases of typhoid fever do you think
developed in consequence of the sewage pollution in your water
supply?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Yes; that is approximately how many cases?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. There is no doubt that the breaking of the intake
pipe was practically the cause of the epidemic. We have had too
high a typhoid content always until the water was heavily chlorinated.
We have chlorinated our water since 1910.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Previous to that time did you have an epidemic
of typhoid?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. We had in 1909 a slight epidemic. There were,
perhaps, 25 or 30 cases. I could not give you the exact number now.
We had none in 1910. The dredging that was being done along the
river front was practically the cause of the epidemic. We have never
been as free from typhoid as we were this last summer. We have
never had any cases that we could trace to the water since it has been
highly chlorinated. Still our water is always suspicious, and if
anything went wrong with the chlorination plant we would surely
have typhoid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. At the time of the last epidemic the water was
chlorinated?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes; but it was not chlorinated highly enough. We
practically got sewage into our water pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I suppose there was too great a burden thrown on your
chlorinating system?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. In the official circles of your city has the question of
purification of your sewage ever been mooted or discussed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Not of our sewage. We have been for some time
agitating very seriously the question of putting in a filtration plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is for your water for consumption?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But what about the sewage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. The sewage is never treated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Have any demands been made upon you by the
public-health service of Ontario to improve your system?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. We have been notified that the time would come
when we would have to do that. We are trying to get our filtration
plant in. We thought last year that we practically had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You would look after your water and let the other
fellow look after the sewage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Self-preservation first, always.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Have you any complaints against the pollution of
water from this side crossing over to the Canadian side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I do not know that we have. Examinations made
by our local board have shown that for several miles up the river the
pollution is practically constant in the raw water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Across the whole river?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Right across the channel. We examined all the
way across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But you have had no independent examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes; we have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And that independent examination showed the same
results as our examinations?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Practically the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Showing that contamination extends across the whole
channel?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Across the whole channel and all the way up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Has any opposition on the part of the citizens to
purification of the sewage, or sterilization of it, ever manifested
itself?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I think not. It has been mooted, but no definite
action has been taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Why was not definite action taken in compliance
with the request of the provincial board?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I think the lack of funds was the main thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Did you ever have studies made as to sewage treatment
in Brockville?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. No; I think not; not for Brockville especially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. It is just your water supply that you are contemplating
improving?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. At the present time that is all. We know that we
shall have to improve the other in time. No doubt it is dangerous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. But you have not seriously considered it so far?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I can not say that we have. It has not been brought
to my notice if it has been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The engineer can probably answer this question, but
his experience may not go far enough back. Has any investigation
ever been made as to the natural facilities that are afforded for
sedimentation beds and things of that kind on the other side of the
boundary?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I think not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you ever heard of any complaints owing to
sewage from vessels passing up and down the river?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Yes; we have heard complaints. During the year
1909 one of our wharves was in bad condition, and many of the large
boats stopped at a point that was practically over the end of our
intake pipe. That was doubtless the cause of our epidemic. There is
no doubt that the year the boats were there there was an epidemic.
We went so far as to prohibit the boats staying there. We prohibited
the large liners or passenger boats tying up to that wharf.
For some months, however, they did tie up to the wharf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. As a man having to do with sanitary matters, what
is your opinion regarding the effect of the boats discharging the
sewage into the river? Is the discharging of that sewage into the
river detrimental to health on your side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Undoubtedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I would like to say, Mr. Chairman, that if Dr.
Macauley as the health officer of a great town along the river here
wishes to make any statement to the commission he may do so. He
may have gotten the idea that he is here to ask questions. If he has
anything to say on the subject, this is the time to say it.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I do not know of anything special at this time.
Something may later suggest itself to my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Can anyone here give us information as to the number
of vessels passing up and down this river in front of Brockville?
Is there any record that would give such information?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I do not think we have any such record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I suppose, Dr. Macauley, that you are willing to
say that the tonnage passing up and down the river here is very
large?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. Certainly there are a great many people passing
up and down the river on the line of boats, the <i>Kingston</i> and the
<i>Toronto</i>, especially this season. Owing to the fact that the season
has been a very hot one, the boats have been crowded all summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I suppose the reports of the lock masters of the canals
would give us some idea of the number of boats passing up and
down.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Macauley</span>. I do not think so, because a large portion of the
travel comes from the train or from Brockville; but a large number
of passengers would go only as far as Prescott. I think it would be
only a fractional part would go to Montreal.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. G. H. BRYSON,<br> CITY ENGINEER OF BROCKVILLE,
ONTARIO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Mr. Bryson, you are the city engineer of Brockville,
are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How long have you held that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Four and a half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you with you plans of your sewerage system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No; I did not bring any. They are on file with the
commission’s original report of 1914.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Can you give us a general outline of the character
of your sewerage system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. The town is divided into two systems. One system
discharges into what is called the west-end division. The main
sewerage area takes about three-fourths of the area of the town and
discharges about 820 feet from the intake pipe. It starts with a 16-inch
outlet and then follows up with an 8-inch outlet in the river.
The original system was laid out to take only sanitary sewage, but
for some reason that was abandoned. The west-end system is a
9-inch pipe, except the small piece of 8-inch cast-iron pipe running
into the river. That discharges about half a mile above the intake
pipe. It is practically all sanitary sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is the nature of the surface of the country
there? Is it flat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No; it is very hilly. We have really three watersheds
in the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. As an engineer, would it, in your judgment, be very
difficult to put an intercepting sewer in there for the purpose of
purifying the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Plans have been gotten out for intercepting all the
west end sewage and bringing it into the main system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Have those plans been approved by the public
health service?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No; they have never gone to them, but it is a recommendation
from them that the sewage from the west end be pumped
into the main sewerage system. That was one of the conditions contained
in the original order, that the west end sewage be passed into
the main sewerage system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the estimated cost of that work?.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. About $10,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That was a suggestion for the purification of your
sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. It was just simply to divert the sewage so it would go
out below the intake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You have never taken into consideration the purification
of your sewage before it is discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No; nothing has been done about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the axis of this rotary area where you have
the back flow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is a back flow on the Brockville side. What is
the major axis, and what is the minor axis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. It flows west to about the Canadian Pacific Railway
dock and then turns down the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. About how far is it from where it starts to flow up to
the end of the curve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. It starts about half a mile below the town. I should
think it is out about 800 feet. The intake is supposed to be across
the present eddy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Just beyond it, near the margin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. During your time has the pollution increased very
much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. It has increased with the population in the western
end of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you ever made any estimate as to what the cost
would be of sterilization by sedimentation or otherwise of the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. So far as I can gather, you have been the chief offender
against yourself in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. I think so, Mr. Magrath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Your concern has been chiefly in regard to your water
supply?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. It has been to protect ourselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. And you have no complaint to make about the water
being polluted in the stream above you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Are there any large towns below Brockville that
would be polluted by your sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Prescott is the only possible place that could be affected
by it, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is no surface sewage that passes into your western
system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. There is very little; nothing to speak of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Does all the surface sewage in the lower system pass
into your pipes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. It passes into other pipes now; but for the last four
years we have been taking out such surface sewage as we could because
we have been having very heavy floods in the lower pipes of
the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Could you avoid a pumping system in disposing of
your sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No; we have to pump. The location of a plant would
be very difficult from the present point of discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you any idea from what elevation you would
have to pump the sewage in order to dispose of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. I think to get land we would have to go outside
of the town limits entirely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But how high would you have to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. About 90 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That would be quite expensive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Yes. There is no available land in sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You have no general statement that you wish to
make regarding this situation, have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Dr. Macauley was asked about the pollution in the
river. Last year I went out all over the lake taking samples and
sent them to the provincial board of health. Every one showed contamination.
We crossed the main channel and right over to the
American side. We went up the river to Big Island.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Did that investigation cover the whole surface of
the river from shore to shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. We took samples every 400 feet right across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have there ever been any complaints made by the
lower communities on your side against the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You have never been threatened with any lawsuits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. May I ask Mr. Bryson a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Mr. Bryson, in speaking of purifying the sewage of
the town of Brockville you said it would have to be pumped for a
considerable distance. Do not the sewers go down some of the principal
streets of Brockville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Is it not possible that a plant could be built under
ground beneath those streets to take care of the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. I do not think so. I think we would have to spend
too much money in rock excavation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. I know that Mr. Murray, of Toronto, suggested that
system to me some years ago. He said it could be taken care of without
pumping at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Our outlet is in rock now and it is below the level of
the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is not much rise and fall of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River here, is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. No; not very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. About what is the range?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. About 4 feet at Brockville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is there much shallow water on the Brockville side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Not along the main water front. It is only along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the west end that it begins to get shallow. There is a shoal over
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is there an area there of some acres of shallow water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Could you not dike it off? Or would that be too
expensive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bryson</span>. Yes; it would be too expensive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Is there anyone else from Brockville who wishes
to be heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. Possibly we might hear from the chairman of the
water commission, if the question of filtration is of any interest to
this commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. This commission is not so much concerned about
the purification of your water supply as about the purification of
your sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. I understand that. The point we wish to establish
is that so far as our experience goes we have not been able to find
pure water in the river irrespective of any pollution that comes from
the town of Brockville. While no doubt there is pollution from the
sewage in the town of Brockville, at the same time in all our experience
with the river we have been unable to find pure water in
the neighborhood of the town, either above or below the sewage
outlet. Therefore, we have come to the conclusion that the river is
polluted irrespective of our sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Do you know of any community treating the sewage
above you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. The commission would be glad to hear from the
chairman of the water commission.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. W. H. KYLE, CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC<br>
UTILITIES COMMISSION OF BROCKVILLE, ONTARIO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: We had tests made of
the water above the town, away above any contamination from our
sewage, and I believe to-day if we could get pure water above Brockville
we could put a pumping plant up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. And treat your sewage so as to leave the people
below you in the same position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. We are in the position that we take that as an international
question, and there would be no use of their treating it unless
it is made general. The water is polluted also from the big insane
asylum there. That will have to be taken into consideration when
the question of the town of Brockville is considered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Where is that located, in reference to your city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. It is about a mile below our city. I believe we can not
get any pure water in the river at the present time and that we shall
have to treat our sewage and also put in a filtration plant. I believe
that the trouble in our water is caused by shipping. I remember
passing one of those big liners in a motor boat one day. I do not
know what sort of an apparatus they had, but they dumped the
material, and everybody immediately grabbed their handkerchiefs
and held their noses until they got by. I believe that has a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
deal to do with the contamination of the water. Many of the summer
residents also wrap their garbage in paper and throw it in the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That is increasing in amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Every year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Have you any idea as to the summer population
above Brockville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Practically all the islands are occupied now, as well as
the shores, by summer residents, and at Alexandria Bay there are
thousands and thousands of people every day. I think we are getting
more contamination from the vicinity of Alexandria Bay than
we are perhaps from Gananoque.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How far are you from Alexandria Bay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. About 22 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How far are you from Gananoque?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. About 30 miles. I think probably in another year we
will filter our water. I think the water should be filtered, no matter
whether the sewage is treated or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I suppose the point you make, Mr. Kyle, is that
unless all communities treat their sewage, the treatment of sewage at
Brockville would not help you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. It would not affect us and would not affect the other
towns. They would still have to chlorinate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. In other words, the water as it comes down from
Brockville is already polluted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. And I suppose, inasmuch as the summer population
on the islands is increasing, you could hardly expect that any system
of treatment of sewage or garbage going into the river could be ever
attempted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. I do not know just how they would get after them. But
they would have to burn the garbage and treat their sewage. It is a
serious question for the municipalities. They have all issued debentures
for putting in plants for the disposal of the sewage, I suppose
with the permission of the Government. Some towns can do it very
easily, but in our town it would be a very serious question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I understand that no studies have been made as to
sewage treatment in Brockville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Well, not to any great extent. The engineers have
informed us that it would be a very expensive undertaking on account
of the rocky formation and the hilly ground on which we are
located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. As I understand you, your personal view is that there
should be a general prevention of the deposit into the river of raw
sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes; it is my view that it should be prevented by both
the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You think it should be prevented by all concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes; by all concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. All communities should be prohibited from depositing
raw sewage into the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You would still have trouble from the campers on
the islands, even if the communities treated their sewage?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. And from navigation also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes, sir; also from navigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You are in favor of that as applying to the whole
community, but you think that it would be of no avail for any
particular community to attempt purification because of the communities
above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes, sir; because the boats would still contaminate the
water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you ever brought to the notice of the steamboat
association the pollution of the waters of the river through
the boats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Only by ordering them away from our docks. We have
a dock at the pumping station where the boats sometimes land, and
we have refused to allow them to land; but that applies more to our
old intake pipe than to the present one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But the fact remains that their presence there has
the effect of polluting the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. We simply ordered them away as a precaution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Was it a mere precautionary measure or was it because
they were a source of pollution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. At that time we believed they were stirring up the
water, and the diver told us that the bottom was all soft stuff and
it would be naturally stirred up and go into the intake pipe. They
can not do that now. There is no question but what our water with
the new intake pipe is very much better than we got before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Then, what is the ground of your complaint? Is it
against the steamboats in that they stir up the deposit at the bottom
of the river, or that they add to the pollution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. At the present time they add to the pollution. I do
not think they stir it up to any great extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And you believe that is a real source of danger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Do you think that the passenger traffic is of sufficient
size to be a danger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. I do. I think a thousand people coming out on a
boat would produce pollution in the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you any idea of the number of people that
passed up and down the river in boats during a season within the
past two years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. The excursion steamer <i>Thousand Islander</i> goes out
with a thousand people. It very seldom goes farther than Alexandria
Bay, which is about 28 miles from Brockville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How many trips does she make a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. She makes a trip every day, practically; but that is
only one of the boats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you think that on an average a thousand people
a day pass up and down the river during the period of navigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. For the total number of boats; yes, sir; very many
more. I think that around Alexandria Bay there are two or three
thousand people, or more, perhaps, every day, because the boats
from Kingston run in there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Dewey has just informed me that he thinks there would be
30,000 people during the day within 30 miles of Brockville on passenger
steamers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That would have reference to the whole navigation
season?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Yes; and during July and August I think it would be
a very conservative estimate to say that there would be 35,000 people
on steamers every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. About how many freight steamers pass up and down
daily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. I could not say. There is a continuous line of them.
The majority of the boats that go through the Welland Canal, freight
boats, that pass down the river, pass by here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I do not suppose you have any means of knowing
what the average river population would be during the entire navigation
season?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. It would fall off greatly, of course, after what you
might term the vacation season?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. My estimate of the number of people, tourists, would
be from the regular line of boats and the excursion steamers passing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How late do these steamers run on the river here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Until the middle of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Can you give us an idea as to the population on
the islands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. On the islands in the immediate vicinity of Brockville
there are about 1,500 people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You say Brockville people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Probably Brockville people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. But from elsewhere than Brockville, what would
the total be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. The number of nonresidents of Brockville that would
be in the vicinity of Brockville would not be very large.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I am referring to the population that might affect
the water flowing past Brockville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. There would not be any substantial increase there,
but I should think it would be safe to say that there would be anywhere
from 5,000 to 10,000 people in the immediate vicinity of Alexandria
Bay and Clayton during the summer months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I was told that on one island alone there were pretty
nearly 10,000 people as a floating population.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Yes; that is on Thousand Island Park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You will find the floating population of Thousand
Islands and Alexandria Bay to be pretty close to 50,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Yes; but these would be permanent for the summer.
There is practically none in the immediate vicinity of Brockville
occupied by summer cottages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Taking the region that we have loosely called the
Thousand Island region, what would be the floating population of
those islands and the vicinity on the main land?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kyle</span>. That is difficult to say because they are coming in by the
thousand every day and staying a day and then leaving. I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
100,000 a day would be a conservative estimate for the islands and
the immediate shores.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Mr. Dallyn, did the bacteriological examinations
that were made on the river here cover the season when the floating
population was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. There were two examinations made. We were on the
river with a laboratory from about the middle of April until the end
of May, and from about the 10th of August, to the 20th of August.
It is reported in the progress report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you any data, exact or otherwise, as to the summer
population of the district?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. No; but I think there is something in Dr. McLaughlin’s
report as to that. We made no calculations ourselves. I know
the populations of Cape Vincent and Clayton double themselves in
the summer; but what the island population and the excursion population
were I have not any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Is there any record available to show what that
summer population amounts to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. It is rather important to know because that is a
feature, that and the pollution, and it strikes me at the present moment
that even if the communities treat their sewage and the boats
sterilize theirs, there will be still a danger from this summer population
camping on the islands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Yes; that is true. They will come, of course, under
township regulations. I do not know just how they handle them on
the American side. In the Muskoka Lakes we make them treat their
sewage properly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How do they accomplish that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. They have various methods of getting at it. Some
use the chemical process, and store it and pump it out in a nocuous
form into beds. Some lay piles through the sand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is your opinion as to the danger of pollution
from your summer population?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. It is very serious. We were very much amazed in
making a minute survey on some of the islands to find that their sewage
outlet and their intakes would be only 40 feet away from each
other, making it practically certain that the two would mingle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Dallyn, I have here a report which you and Dr.
McLaughlin and Dr. McCullough made, a portion of which I wish to
read into the record. From page 50 of the progress report I read as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While examination below Wolfe Island among the Thousand Islands did not
show an average gross pollution, its intermittent character presents a menace
to the summer residents in this section who take their supply of water from the
river without purification.</p>

<p>Examinations made in the vicinity of Brockville showed that the shore samples
collected from the cross section above Brockville carried considerable pollution.
Toward midstream, where dilution and mixing had taken place, the samples
showed constant pollution of lesser degree. Below Brockville the major
pollution remained near the banks of the river. Samples collected in midstream
showed very little pollution in the early work before navigation opened.
The latter work in August showed a very general serious pollution, due probably
to summer resort population and to boat traffic. The condition of the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
between Brockville and Cornwall is very bad in the summer months, as evidenced
by midstream samples Nos. 266-273.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, the water from this portion of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River should
not be used as a water supply without adequate purification.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It is a fact, is it not, that the pollution at these summer
resorts is steadily and rapidly increasing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Undoubtedly so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. There has been more this year than ever before, on
account of the long period of hot weather, and also the fact that
many people who have formerly gone abroad on their vacations have
remained here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. The education of the people has improved very materially
during the last few years, and they demand better conditions
at the summer resorts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You are quite familiar with the Thousand Island
region, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. We spent about a month there in small boats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Passing in and out among the islands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Bearing in mind what Mr. Tawney read from the
progress report to the effect that there was a greater admixture of
water above Brockville than below, that would be due, would it not,
to the various channels and rapids among these islands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Yes, sir; and the channel is very tortuous just at that
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And there are jetties in all directions, which result
in a general churning and admixture of the water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. We discovered that the Cataraqui Bay at Kingston
periodically discharged itself completely into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence.
That would give us a very high pollution. It is simply a tidal effect.
The river seems to flow in both directions opposite Kingston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. How far is it from Kingston to Charlotte?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I am really not aware. I imagine it would be about
130 miles.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF F. S. EVANSON,<br>MAYOR OF PRESCOTT, ONTARIO.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Prescott lies opposite Ogdensburg on the Canadian
side of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River, and the river at this point is about
1¼ miles in width. We have a splendid water system in Prescott
for a town of its size. We obtain the water in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River. We have three outlets for our sewers. We discharge our
sewage into the river in a raw condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you ever contemplated the purification of
your sewage in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. We have never considered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You have never had it under consideration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. In your opinion, would it be a difficult thing to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. No; I think we could treat it all right. Prescott
has been most fortunate in that we have not had any experience of
an epidemic of any kind. Brockville has been troubled with typhoid
for some years, but we have been free from it. We never attempted
to chlorinate the water until Brockville had an epidemic a few years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
ago, and we chlorinated the water as a precaution. At present we
have not a case of fever in Prescott. You will find that the fever
cases in Prescott are much below the average.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You are satisfied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. We are satisfied with the conditions as they exist
at present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How long have you been treating your water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Since the epidemic in Brockville we have been treating
it most of the time. I regret that the medical health officer of
the municipality could not come here to-day. I may state that the
quantity of chlorine we put into the water is lowered at certain seasons
of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Did you have anything of the nature of an epidemic
in your town before you commenced to treat the water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. We never had. I was mayor of the town in 1910
and 1911 and during that time I asked the medical health officer frequently
to send in samples of our water, and he did so. He took the
water from the taps in the town, and not from the river, and it was
rarely shown that it was contaminated in any way. I can only remember
one occasion on which there was slight contamination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. At what point in the river is your intake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. The intake pipe is at the most westerly point in the
town and it runs into the river for 400 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you find the channel within that distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. No; we would not be out in the channel at that distance.
The nearest sewer pipe is 1,500 feet from the intake pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That would be down the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Yes. Of course I think the current of the river at
Prescott improves the conditions there. It is said that the water
flows by there at about 4 miles an hour. We have no eddies at all
such as they have at Brockville. At Brockville there is a point that
juts out and obstructs the flow of the river at the west side, and that
is the cause of the eddy there, but we have no eddy whatever at
Prescott.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Is the river narrower opposite Prescott than it is
opposite Brockville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. I think it is about the same width as at Brockville;
we are about a mile and a quarter across here.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. The river is one mile and three-quarters wide
at Brockville.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is the average depth of the river here from
shore to shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. I can not say as to that. Of course, along our
docks at Prescott, the river is 14 or 15 feet, and the two Richelieu
boats are in there every morning, the one from the west coming in
at 7 o’clock, and it remains there until 10 o’clock or half past 10, and
the boat from the west comes in at 10 o’clock and remains there until
noon. The sewage would not contaminate our water because the
sewage outlets are at least half a mile east of our intake pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Did you notice any disturbance of the river bottom
when these steamboats are leaving or arriving at the wharf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. No. Of course the town owns the western wharf
where our water system is and no boats tie up there at all; the only
boat that comes there is an occasional boat with coal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have the town authorities at Prescott ever considered
the advisability of purifying or sterilizing the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. In 1911 we put in a further sewerage extension in
the east end of the town. We had two outlets then. We extended
the sewer in the east end of the town, and in order to get an outlet
for that extension we had to put the east one farther west, and the
question was considered then, but it was decided that it was useless
to purify the sewage at one small outlet and let the two larger outlets
go without purification. The question received some consideration
then. It was suggested that we could put in a plant which
would take care of the purification of the sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you the same rock formation at Prescott as at
Brockville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. I do not know of any harder rock than we have at
Prescott; you are liable to run into it at any place in the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What is the assessed value of the property in your
municipality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. A little over $2,000,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What is your rate of taxation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. The rate of taxation varies from 25 to 27 mills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Is the water supply of your town satisfactory to
the public health authorities of Ontario?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is the basis of taxation; is it the full value of
the property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. No; I think it is about 75 per cent of the value of
the property, I think that is the way the assessor places it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the rate of taxation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Twenty-seven mills on the dollar last year; that is
$27 on the thousand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Does that cover everything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Yes; of course it does not cover the water and light
rate; it covers the general taxes of the town and the school rate; the
school rate is about 11 mills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. The individuals who consume the water pay for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Yes; and the municipality owns it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your indebtedness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Our indebtedness would run about $170,000. I
should say that in the neighborhood of $100,000 of that covers the
water and light system. Of course, the water and the light take care
of their own departments. We own the water and the light plants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. And a proportion of your indebtedness is because of
your ownership of these utilities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Yes. When we put in the water and light systems
in 1900 we issued debentures for $120,000 at that time to take care
of it. We have extended the sewerage system since at a cost of
$25,000 or $30,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. If the purification of sewage is made obligatory along
the river here I suppose that your town would have no objection to
comply with the general rule?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Certainly not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. But you would have objection to be singled out and
compelled to do that if other people were allowed to go free?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. Yes. Prescott is most fortunate in having first-class
water in the river here, and that has been the condition for a number
of years. I think it proves that flowing water will purify itself in a
distance of 12 miles, because there must be a great amount of sewage
flowing into the river at Brockville, which is 12 miles above us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Unless you have some general statement to make to
the commission I think that is all we want to hear from you, Mr.
Evanson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Evanson</span>. I have nothing further to say. I say that the municipality
of Prescott will be glad to carry out the wishes of this commission
and of the United States and Canada if a means can be devised
to purify sewage.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT AS TO ASSESSED VALUE OF BROCKVILLE.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I wish to ask the mayor of Brockville what the
assessed valuation of the town is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span> (city clerk, Brockville). The assessed valuation of the
town is about $5,000,000, and the population 9,500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your rate of taxation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Thirty mills this year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your basis of value; is it full value?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. No. Under the law it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is that a supposition contrary to the fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Taking it on the whole, I presume it would be 75 or
80 per cent of the value.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. It is high enough at that rate, I should think.
What is your indebtedness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. The net debt, including public utilities, is $600,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What do your public utilities cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Electricity, gas, and water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is there any surplus from the supply of electricity,
gas, and water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. There is a slight surplus over the operating charges
and the amount necessary to take care of the debt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How are you paying that? Is it by a sinking
fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Some of it. Some of it is payable in annual installments.
We issue debentures both ways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is your debt diminishing or increasing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. I think it is diminishing. Our local improvement
debt constitutes the bulk of the debt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. And these public utilities carry themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dewey</span>. Yes. The local improvement indebtedness is paid
largely by the property owners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. It might be well to state for the information of
those gentlemen who have come here from a distance that we are
to hear this afternoon Mr. Paterson, an expert in the matter, in reference
to methods of treating pollution. It might be interesting to
these gentlemen to stay here to hear Mr. Paterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It may interest these gentlemen, because Mr. Paterson
claims that the municipalities could make a large profit out of
the treatment of this sewage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You would be able to pay off your indebtedness,
perhaps, if you took Mr. Paterson’s advice.</p>

<p>(The commission took recess for luncheon.</p>

<p>After the luncheon recess.)</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. EDWARD A. PATERSON.<br>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward A. Paterson</span>, chemical engineer, London, England, appeared
before the commission and said:</p>

<p>After I received the telegram from the secretary of the Canadian
section of the commission asking me to come here I cabled to London
for certain plans and models and additional samples, as I only had
a few samples on this side and a few notes. These samples and reports
have not yet got here, I suppose owing to the war conditions.
I therefore have to rely upon rough laboratory notes, which I hope
to augment with further information as soon as the data arrive
here. I hope you will excuse me for not having the short report
which I have made in fuller detail. I shall be glad to give you more
interesting information later.</p>

<p>I may state, first, that my remarks are purely from the British
point of view; I am not at all familiar with the conditions on this
side, except as to a few of the plants, such as the Baltimore plant
and others, where they have erected up-to-date plants for the collection
of the solids. I have been investigating this matter for about
six years purely from the point of view of the disposal of the solids,
and I have looked upon it from the utilization point of converting
waste products into a commercial enterprise. Our difficulty in Great
Britain is that we have an enormous accumulation of what we call
sludge cake or sewage cake, which comes mostly from the filter press,
and in some cases it is taken out to sea and in others it is disposed
of on the land and in other cases they burn it. In England alone we
have enormous quantities of this material, which costs from 1 shilling
to 5 shillings—that is, from 25 cents to $1.25—per ton of wet sludge.
When I refer to “wet sludge,” I mean sludge that contains from
50 to 60 per cent of water.</p>

<p>As to the raw material, the process to which I will refer deals with
the raw sewage which has been precipitated or agglomerated by
means of lime, “ferro-alumina,” or other agent, and rendered solid
either by filter pressing or “lagooning” at the sewage-disposal works.
This solid material contains on an average 50 to 55 per cent moisture
and must, owing to its nature, be quickly disposed of, because
for about six months in the year it becomes extremely offensive, and
they have in England a very small area in which to dispose of it. It
has to be taken away by railway trains and in boats and such like
conveyances. In Great Britain the amount of solid material—containing
50 per cent moisture—produced by each 1,000 inhabitants is
approximately 100 tons per annum, and, for the purposes of this
report, those towns in the United Kingdom having a population of
over 100,000 people produce annually 1,800,000 tons.</p>

<p>In disposing of it we look upon it from the commercial point of
view, and, therefore, the composition of the sewage is very important.</p>

<p>The composition of raw sewage, of course, must vary very considerably,
depending on the time of year and the district which it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
derived from—trades waste, and so forth, e. g., paper factories, iron
works, dye works, render it very complex, and an ever-varying mixture,
but the following analysis will give a very general idea of its
character and composition in Great Britain:</p>

<p>I have a sample here of the material that is generally produced at
the sewage works.</p>

<p>(Sample produced and shown to the commissioners.)</p>

<p>That sample contains from 55 to 60 per cent of water and is as it
comes from the filter press, and it is called filter-press cake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That is not in commercial form?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. No; that is in the form, as it comes from the
sewage works, and it is material that gives us much trouble to dispose
of. The analysis of that material, not air dried, is approximately—by
“approximately” I mean the general analysis of that
class of material over the United Kingdom—as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">These analyses will give a general idea of the composition of filter-pressed
sewage cake, which we treat in Great Britain, and of which
we have 1,800,000 tons per annum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>The object of the process under consideration is to dry the solids
so that they may be available either for a fertilizer or, secondly,
to be in a condition that by-products of commercial value can be
recovered. The greatest difficulty with which we have had to contend
was to provide a way of liberating the moisture, of which the pressed
cake contained from 55 to 60 per cent, without volatilizing valuable
material, and at the same time achieve the object in a short space of
time and at low cost. One of the difficulties that has caused a great
deal of time and trouble to solve is how to get rid of that moisture
and dry the material at a moderate cost without losing any of the
valuable constituents, because the valuable products are volatilized
at a very low temperature. A very large amount of money and
time has been spent in Great Britain in trying to dry sewage pressed
cake, or sewage sludge, economically, and many ingenious mechanical
appliances have been invented to try and solve the difficulty, but they
have not been a success, as they have been costly to operate and required
high temperature, with consequent loss of some of the valuable
constituents of the sewage. This is due to the water in the sewage
being in so many different forms, namely, hydroscopic water, water
of combination, and water of crystallization; the first being easy to
drive off and the two latter extremely difficult. So it is recognized
now that the problem is one of chemistry and mechanics applied, and
I can safely say that there is now a satisfactory solution of these
difficulties on a practical scale.</p>

<p>Further on in this report I will give you some figures as to the
cost of plant and cost per ton of drying pressed cake.</p>

<p>Having dried the material, it is in a condition to be treated by
destructive distillation, whereby ammonia, oil, gas, fat, phenols,
and other materials suitable for drugs and dye making may be
extracted.</p>

<p>I show you a sample of the material as dried. It appears in that
form [specimen exhibited], and it contains 50 to 55 and 60 per cent
of water. After it is dried it becomes absolutely, as you
see it there. That specimen is practically free from water; it contains
only about 2 per cent of water. That material is valuable
as a fertilizer, and it is sold in the form of a butter. [Butter specimen
exhibited.]</p>

<p>The value of the material, as any chemist knows, is in its fertilizing
contents for particular purposes. For certain purposes, the
merchants who deal in the product add the necessary quantities
of phosphoric acid that the material is deficient in, to bring it up
to Government standard. That material is worth to-day on the
English markets from $12 to $15 a ton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is the relative proportion of potash to phosphoric
acid in that sample?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. It varies very much, indeed. In small towns where
it does not pay to extract—where there is not sufficient tonnage to
pay for extracting the oil and the fat from these other products—they
are either put into this form, or, if the towns are sufficiently
near a large center, it is shipped on the railway to central works
where it is treated for these products. But in isolated cases they
simply dry the material by a special process, and they have local
sale for it, and it is cheap to operate, so that where a man is usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
employed in these plants the man can do the whole thing, and you
can practically make a small number of people the limit of cost.
Taking about 1,000 as being about the limit, or 500 persons, they
can put it into this form and use it for manure purposes.</p>

<p>Oils are interesting to the British people, because we have no oil
in England outside of the oils which are obtained in very small
quantities from the Scottish shale deposits, so that when you are dealing
with several million tons of material which will produce a very
large quantity of oil per ton it becomes a matter of extreme interest
to the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Sir Boverton Redwood, Bart., D. Sc., F. I. C., and Alfred Gordon
Salamon, A. R. S. M., F. I. C., the former of whom is one of the
consulting chemists of the British Government, state in a report on
this process, made two years ago:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That the process is capable of furnishing valuable commercial products
for which there is a practically unlimited market. In this connection, we may
state that the sample of crude oil distillate which was subjected to test remained
fluid until cooled to 20° F., had a specific gravity of 0.971 at 60° F.,
and a flash point of 256° F. A sample of the redistilled oil previously tested
by us contained only 0.24 per cent of sulphur, and had a calorific value of
10,230 calories per gram, or 18,415 British thermal units. It is evident that
a product similar to the crude oil examined would be a fuel oil complying with
the contract requirements of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>2. That very large supplies of the raw material, viz, sewage-sludge press
cake, would be available in this country as soon as it became recognized that
such press cake could be disposed of.</p>

<p>3. That it may be reasonably anticipated that a substantial profit would
result from the general application of the process.</p>
</div>

<p>The yields of valuable products, of course, vary within very wide
limits, depending upon the composition of the sewage, but, speaking
broadly, the amount of ammonia as sulphate ranges between 60 and
130 pounds per ton of sewage containing 5 to 10 per cent of moisture.
Oil, from 18 to 40 gallons per ton; fat, from 5 to 10 per ton; gas, from
14,000 to 17,000 cubic feet per ton. The rare products, it is difficult
to give any reasonable figures. Then, after these products have
been extracted, there is a residue which has a commercial value as a
fertilizer base, as it contains products valuable for agricultural purposes.
It is an inodorous grayish-black friable substance having the
following general composition.</p>

<p class="p2">The commercial value of sulphate of ammonia may be usually
taken at 2 cents a pound, in Great Britain. It is difficult to say what
the commercial value of these products is to-day, in war time. We
obtain from 5 to 10 per cent of fat, and under special conditions,
such as they have at Bradford, which is a wool-washing place, the
amount of fat runs up to 20 per cent. It is difficult to give any definite
figures as to the value of other products, because they vary in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
different localities, but there is a fair amount of substances which
are used in drug making.</p>

<p>That butter, or residue, after these other products are taken out,
is absolutely innocuous, and quite a deodorizer because of the amount
of carbon it contains.</p>

<p>That material is used by the fertilizing companies and they add
to it the requisite amount of ammonia or phosphoric acid, or potash,
or what is required for particular kinds of agriculture.</p>

<p>One of the chief products is oil, and the analysis of the crude oil
obtained from the process is as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">The crude oil is a very dark thick-looking substance, very much
like what you would see lubricating any bearing of engines, and very
much like the crude oil that is obtained from the oil wells of this
country. It can be split up and fractionated into different parts. It
has not a very pleasant smell or a very unpleasant smell; it is quite
different from the ordinary crude oil you get from the earth, but
several different spirits can be obtained, which are useful for driving
motor cars, internal combustion engines, and so on.</p>

<p>After that black crude oil has been split up into these various
grades, and various other compounds taken out, there remains in
the still a pitch which is practically animal pitch, and which is useful
for all kinds of things for which bone pitch is used. [Sample
produced.]</p>

<p>The extraordinary thing is to think that that comes through a
human being, but it does.</p>

<p>I have no sulphate of ammonia with me; it is such a common
thing, you will see it in any drug store, it is used in most households,
and it is known to everybody. The mean calorific value of the gases
after the extraction of all condensible oils in the process was found
to be 130 British thermal units. It will be noted that all the products
mentioned in this analysis are easily salable, and always in demand.</p>

<p>These products are extracted in this way: The chief process is
drying material, which has been one of the greatest difficulties in
solving the sewage problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the device used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. They have revolving cylinders, they have chambers,
they have glass houses, they have towers that it is worked down
through; all these sorts of things. In this process they take the gases
which are coming from the garbage plant, and pass them through a
brick chamber in which there is an endless belt made of wire-woven
mesh. That travels a distance of about 120 feet in 20 minutes, and
the carbonic-acid gas from the furnace, in conjunction with certain
other material, creates a chemical reaction which breaks up these
various forms of water, and in 20 minutes the material is dry, and in
that condition in which you now see it. Having obtained it in that
condition, if it is not used for fertilizing, it is put into a gas plant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
which consists of retorts, in which the coal is thrown, the door
closed, and heat applied. The volatile matter, gas and tar and so on,
goes over in the condensers and the gas passes on and leaves behind it
a tar and ammonia and liquor, etc. This process is very similar to
the ordinary gas process, with this exception, that the ordinary gas
retorts are not suitable, owing to the extremely low heat-conducting
properties of dry sewage. So, special retorts have had to be constructed,
and they are mostly vertical and in benches of 4 or 8 or 12
or 16. The material is taken along an automatic feed and pumped
into these retorts and the top closed, and then the oil goes through a
condenser and is thrown down in that form in which you see it.
Steam is introduced and the ammonia runs over, the steam is condensed,
and the ammonia is in that ammoniacal liquid. The ammonia
is extracted from that liquid and the oil floats on the top and
flows into these fractionating stills. Then the gas which passes on,
14,000 to 17,000 cubic feet, comes around again and is used for doing
the distillation, so that practically the amount of gas in the sewage
will complete the operation. In other words, it costs practically
nothing for heat for doing the distillation.</p>

<p>The cost of one of these plants will depend on several factors,
the chief of which is the population of the place. To deal with a
small tonnage costs more per ton than to deal with a very large one,
the overhead charges have to be taken into account, so that one is
limited to a certain population for extracting the by-products.</p>

<p>As to whether a drying plant is installed alone or in conjunction
with a distillation plant, this of course could only be decided by
the careful examination of local conditions. Broadly speaking, a
drying plant to treat 30 tons of sewage, containing 55 to 60 per cent
of water, would cost approximately for the machinery $2,500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McGrath</span>. For what population?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. For 1,000 people making 100 tons a year. Usually,
around a municipality, they have buildings and garbage plants
and structures of different kinds, so that practically in most of the
towns I have visited in England that is about the total expense for
machinery, after putting the material into the condition you see it,
without practically any extra labor. The cost of drying in England,
for the plant at Wimbledon is $1.50 per ton. A larger plant
would cost relatively less, as certain mechanical parts that would be
necessary for a small plant would serve a much larger one. In London,
as I have said, it is costing us for drying per ton of sewage
about $1.50, and the value of the product as a fertilizer, which
naturally depends on its chemical composition, is from $12 to $15
per ton, and as a matter of fact on its chemical contents it is worth
more than that. That is a very conservative figure to put upon it,
because the fertilizer people want profits.</p>

<p>The cost of the distillation plant will, of course, vary in different
towns and different localities. It is extremely difficult to give estimates
on the cost of a distillation plant on this continent as the
conditions vary to a large extent, but to generalize, a plant is not expensive
and we consider in England a unit for treating, say, 40 tons
a day of dried sewage would be in the neighborhood of $40,000,
most of which plant would be suitable for treating 100 tons per
day with only the addition of retorts, which is the least expensive
part of the plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>I have gone into the subject in this report in a quite general and
untechnical way, and I shall be pleased to answer any further questions
which you wish to ask me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Where are the plants, which you speak of, situated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. At Wimbledon, which is part of London.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are they operated by the municipality or by private
interests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. They are operated by private interests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do these private interests buy the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. The sewage is delivered to the works free of charge.
Speaking from memory, the cost at Wimbledon is about 75 cents a
ton. They are getting rid of it for nothing, and, in addition to that,
they give the land necessary for the treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How long has that plant been in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. About a year. On account of the war it has been
shut down two or three times by the Government taking the men
away; but now it is practically under Government control, for it
comes under the Munitions Department. It is now looked upon by
the Government as a necessary national project, and comes under
the munitions department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Because of the gasoline they get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. From your knowledge, what do you estimate the
cost of a plant would be for a city of, say, from 50,000 to 100,000
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. I should say from about $40,000 to $50,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That would be about $1 per capita.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. About that; but less per capita for a population of
over 50,000.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. What is the cost of operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. From 35 cents to 50 cents a ton; that, of course,
depends on circumstances and conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What are the elements of cost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. The elements of cost, after the material is dried,
are simply the cost of distillation, which is the principal cost, and
there is also the cost of the maintenance of the plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What labor cost is involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. The labor cost is about 2 shillings per ton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Does the fertilizer possess a solid residue devoid of
organic life; do the seeds germinate at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. That is not our experience; of course, there is
bound to be organic life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I mean, as you deliver it from your plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Not so far as we have found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. I speak of disease germs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. We have not found it so. That dry piece of sewage
which you see there has been in my bag for five months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. This process deals entirely with the solids?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes; it deals entirely with the solids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. And it does not include any treatment of the liquid
sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What would be the minimum population that you
consider it would be feasible to erect a system for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Do you mean commercially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Well, on the dry process, I should think down to
1,000 people, or probably 500 people. In England, the War Office, at
two of their camps, have put in small plants for about 1,000 men.
They call them field destructors, and they get sufficient oil to run the
machines, but they do not save the products.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. What process of sedimentation do you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. They have a series of sedimentation tanks, and they
use both lime and alumina to precipitate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are the costs of the precipitants included in the
cost you have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. No; this is purely for the treatment of the solids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It includes the drying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. The use of chemicals for precipitating in your sedimentation
tanks would make it cost more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. In certain cases they do not use a precipitant at
all, but in other places they do. In places they use lime and alumina,
and that is expensive: It does not affect the process at all if lime
or any other agglomerant is not used, you still have the solids left.
They are rather getting away from lime precipitation on account of
its cost, but, on the other hand, where they have it for a fertilizer
they are getting the value back that they paid for their lime to a
very large degree, and possibly they are making a profit out of it.
There is no doubt that lime does give more rapid precipitation, and
it has its advantages, but it does not affect the solids for treatment
or the by-products that you get from the solids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Do I understand that none of the important centers
have yet taken this matter up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. They have signified their intention to take it up.
Glasgow and Sheffield are contemplating putting in a plant, and
Derby and Leeds. The plants would have been built this year, but
the condition in England now is that no municipality can lend money
without the sanction of the treasury. The plans are drawn for
Glasgow, Leeds, and Sheffield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is this a patented process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. In part; the distillation part is not patented.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Did you tell us what profit is realized out of the
disposal of the sludge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. That could only be given in a general way, depending
on the quantity which is treated. In London, which has 100,000
tons a year, you would naturally make a very large profit there in
comparison to a city of 3,000 or 4,000 or 20,000 people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Take a city of 100,000 people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. It leaves a fair margin of profit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What do you mean by a fair margin of profit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. A fair margin of profit, and to pay for the depreciation
of the plant, the redemption of the plant, the money that is
necessary to keep it up, the cost that the city has gone to, and leave
interest on the money plus decrease of capital, plus profit, I should
think $1 a ton profit on 100,000 people, after paying all this, would
be quite a good thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. I suppose, as a matter of fact, this process is in the
experimental stage, or do you consider it is now sufficiently established?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. It is sufficiently established, because the plant is
paying. It went from the laboratory to a small plant at the rate of
a ton a day, and now it has gone to a bigger one and a bigger one.
We practically hope, and we are pretty sure, that we are going to
take over the London sewage, which would be a very large plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. How much money has been invested in these
plants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. The one at Wimbledon is not a fair criterion, because
it has been in operation for a long time, and it has gone
through all the initial stages of a new process. Now, of course, it
is in perfect order, and running smoothly, and giving good results,
but it has come up from a smaller plant to a large degree, and there
were lots of difficulties encountered which have been surmounted. I
suppose it might be said to cost $300,000 now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. And, in the light of your experience, what do you
estimate you could duplicate that plant for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. The same plant could be put in to-day easily for
$40,000 or $50,000. Of course, in a new process we are continually
putting in different things and trying different things, and also
extracting things which we never dreamed of were in the material.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. Is it not a fact that when the pressed sludge was
first offered to the agricultural interests in England it was taken up
and they paid a certain amount for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dallyn</span>. And, after the system was generally adopted, is it
not so that they could find no demand for it? Do you not think that
if this process were generally adopted the value of the by-products
would decrease on account of the large volume offering?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. I do not think so, because of the nature of the by-products.
Take this continent, and you import an enormous amount
of sulphate of ammonia. The recovery of nitrogen is one of the
problems which the United States Government has taken up within
the last year. We have to have nitrogen, and you can not get it
much cheaper than you can out of sewage, because you have to get
rid of the sewage anyway. I do not think that nitrogen will ever
depreciate in value. They are trying to take it from the air to-day,
and have been fairly successful. Oil will always be valuable, gas
will always be valuable, potash, phosphorus are all absolutely essential
for the human race, and everybody is straining his brains and
experimenting genius in trying to discover methods of getting oil
and nitrogen. It seems to me to have been wicked that the English-speaking
races should have been throwing this material away for
so many years and looking upon it as a curse instead of a blessing.
We can imitate the Germans in a great many respects, and that is
one of them—to keep what is valuable instead of throwing it away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Did you read the testimony of Mr. Hatton given
before the commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Comparing your process to the one he spoke of,
what would you say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. I came to the conclusion, in reading Mr. Hatton’s
report, that he had the same difficulty which we had in Great Britain—that
is, as to treating sewage. He complained that there was
not sufficient sun. He said that after he had dried it that it was
worth $20 a ton—I think he placed the minimum at $15 a ton. But
his difficulty seemed to be with the process of drying and the difficulty
of drying. In some of the plants I visited—in the plant at
Baltimore—they have a drying plant there, and, perhaps I should
not say it, but they have not got any further than we did four
years ago. They had not discovered yet how to get over the difficulty
in drying this material. If you have to wait in the summer
time for the material to air dry, then you have the difficulty of
bad smells, putrescent material lying about, and complaints. The
material should be treated as soon as it is recovered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. According to your system, do you get rid of
these difficulties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes; we get over the difficulties. Formerly it used
to take us two months to dry it, and if we tried to force the drying
by most of the machines that have been invented we would lose
most of the valuable constituents. Glasgow spent £6,000 on a drying
machine, and then it had difficulty, and they were still in that difficulty
five months ago. The difficulty about drying the material is
that you must not drive off the valuable constituents, because if
you do you lose money—you lose the volatile oils, you lose several
things of value—and after it gets dry to a certain extent it becomes
extremely inflammable. This material here that I have shown you
could be used quite suitably as a fuel. It burns beautifully. That
brick there, if you put a match to it, will burn quite easily and make
an excellent fuel. If you want to augment the heating qualities of it,
you can add coal or slack or anything like that to it, because it is
a very excellent fuel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Has this system any distinctive name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. I do not think it has. We have a company in
England, we call it the S. O. S.; not the call for help—it is quite
accidentally called that—but it means Sewage Oil Syndicate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I suppose the difficulty in drying is that if you use
heat to expedite the drying you are apt to drive out the volatile
constituents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You must dry at a reduced heat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes; it dries at a very low temperature. Another
difficulty with the drying is that this sewage cake is so extremely
nonconductive. You could heat it up to a temperature in the
retort of 2,000 F., a piece the size of your fist, and the center will
come out exactly as you put it in the retort. It will retain the
moisture still, almost in the same condition as it went in, after receiving
that high temperature for six hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Has the development of this system proceeded beyond
the experimental stage, or has it yet reached the commercial
stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. Yes, sir; it has reached the commercial stage.
You have to take into consideration that the conditions in Canada
and in the United States are considerably different from what they
are in Great Britain. Great Britain is a smaller country, thickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
populated, and I would want to point out that isolated towns would
not have the same facility of working that we have here. Take a
town like Rochester, and Buffalo, the next town, is 70 or 80 miles
away. A town like Indianapolis, with a population of 300,000, has
around it many towns of 20,000 or 25,000 people which radiate out
from that center, and it would mean an absolutely sure profitable
proposition. In other towns, like in Ontario, where they are isolated,
you could not expect to make as large profits as in these well-situated
towns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the highest percentage of net profit on capital
expenditure? Maybe you do not wish to disclose that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. I do not think that would be wise at the present
stage. Before answering that, I would like to know the conditions
in this country better. One might make a statement as to that and
then fall down lamentably on it after he understood the conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you think that a city of 25,000 inhabitants could
install a plant of this kind for the disposal of sewage at a profit, or
without a loss?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. And using the by-product as a fertilizer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. If a town is situated like Hamilton, in Ontario,
with respect to a large city like Toronto, yes. But not to put up a
by-product plant for itself. It certainly could make a profit. I
think Mr. Hatton bears me out in that, that there is almost an unlimited
demand for this material at about $15 or $20 a ton in
America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. I think Mr. Hatton stated that there was a very
small percentage of fat in the sewage of Milwaukee. I would like
to know whether this system can be applied anywhere, or does it
depend on the nature of the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. In England we take out the fats first in any case,
but where it is used for fertilizing alone, Mr. Hatton is quite correct
in what he says. In England, where we are dealing with large
tonnages and taking out the other by-products, yes, it pays. Generally
speaking, small towns of 25,000 people, unless they are well
situated with relation to larger towns, the only way they can make
a profit, so far as I know, is by drying the product and selling it
as fertilizer, and that they can do at a very moderate cost. A drying
plant will not cost more than $2,500, and the operating expenses
are practically all done with the staff they have; that is, for a small
city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. I wish, Mr. Paterson, on behalf of the commission,
to express to you their thanks, and to say how much we appreciate
that you have come before us from Indianapolis on our invitation
and given us the valuable information which you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. We professional chemists look upon it that we
should render your commission the most useful information which
we have in our possession, and I am sure we are all glad to do so. If
I can be of any further assistance to the commission, I shall be glad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. We appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. If I can give you further information, I shall be
only too pleased to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Paterson stated at the beginning of his statement
that he had a full report on this matter on its way from England,
or that he expected one before long. I would suggest that when
he receives that report he should forward it to the commission, with
any additional data that he wishes to submit to us. I am sure we
would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paterson</span>. I shall be very pleased to do so.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF DR. A. W. GOODALE,<br>OF THOUSAND ISLAND PARK.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your position at Thousand Island Park,
Dr. Goodale?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. I am the secretary of the association and health officer.
I have held those positions for several years. We received a
notice from this commission from Washington to appear here. However,
we have nothing to ask of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What are your particular duties as health officer?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. I have had charge of putting down all the sewers,
looking after our water, getting rid of our closets, and running them
by water instead of having outdoor closets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you a system of sewage disposal there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. We have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your outlet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Our outlet is the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River. We have a
sewer that runs through the center of the park to the river. Then
each street has a sewer that runs into the main sewer, and through
that into the river below where we take our water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your permanent population?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. We haven’t any. I suppose there are a dozen families
living there; not over that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is the population during the vacation season?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. We have a transient population there of about 10,000
tourists. They are there from the 1st of July until about the middle
of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That would include those arriving and departing
day by day?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Yes, sir; but we have about 500 cottages. About 105
cottages and our principal hotel and stores were burned about two
years ago. They were owned by the association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. How near the boundary line is Thousand Island
Park?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. It is about 6 miles across, and we are about in the
center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. About how far is the border of the island from what
you might term the ship canal—the channel where the navigation
goes up and down the river?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. About half a mile. The main channel, I think, is on
the American side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Where is the outlet of your sewers with respect to
that ship channel?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. It goes out pretty near the channel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You do not treat your sewage at all, do you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. No, sir. If I may be allowed to say it without being
asked, I would state that we have the healthiest people that I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of anywhere around. We have no typhoid fever; we have no diphtheria,
scarlet fever, or any of the contagious diseases. We are now
suffering under the misfortune of having to quarantine people in
order to keep out infantile paralysis from New York and other places
south of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you think you contribute anything to the good
health of those farther down the river?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. No, sir; I do not think we do; that is, nothing except
in the way of pure water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You think you have the advantage of them in obtaining
pure water.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Well, we have the same advantage that Detroit and
Niagara Falls and those places above us have of us. We take their
pollution, if there is any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. The two cases are hardly parallel. You are right at
the mouth of a big lake.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Well, virtually we are. I think where the big lakes
empty in is up about Cape Vincent and Kingston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. As a matter of fact, before getting up into the
lake the only town above you of any considerable size that sends sewage
down to you is Clayton, is it not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Clayton and Cape Vincent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you ever considered any plans or schemes for
purification of sewage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. We have had schemes suggested to us with which
I am not familiar that we have considered not to be feasible, on account
of our being situated in such a way that the water goes in
both directions at Thousand Island Park. Part of it goes into the
Canadian channel and part into the American channel. We have
considered schemes of treating the sewage there, and it has always
been so expensive that we could not afford to do it if it had been desirable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That, then, has been the only reason why you have
not formulated plans for the purification of sewage, the matter of expense?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. The matter of expense and the fact that we have not
considered that it was necessary so far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. But you have recognized it as a pending evil?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Yes, sir; we have not dodged that. It is an evil
that has got to be done away with. However, we have not suffered
with it at all. We have about 15 or 20 very good wells from which
we obtain drinking water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Are they artesian wells?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. No, sir; we pump the water, and sometimes a hundred
families get water from one well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You do that, I suppose, because you think you get
better water from your wells than you do from the river?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Well, many have had typhoid fever in Clayton
and many of the residents there have felt afraid to use the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River water. But I do not think it is very bad. I talked with
some boatmen coming down on the <i>Island Belle</i>. They have been
running the <i>Island Belle</i> for 20 years. They say they do not want
any better water. I asked them where they got their water, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
they got it at Clayton or Thousand Island Park, and they said no;
that they got it out in the center of the stream.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You have quite a good deal of navigation going to
and from the island?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Yes, sir; there are a great many boats landing there
every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you any idea of how much of a floating population
there is in the whole region, the mainland and the islands?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Well, it would be a guess. Do you mean during the
summer while the tourists are there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. I should think 50,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I was there before the big hotel was burned and on
that one island alone for a week or so they had a population of over
10,000.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. At Thousand Island Park we have a population of
nearly 10,000 at this minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You think a fair estimate of the total population
would be 50,000?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Yes, sir. Of course, it is all guesswork. I have
no means of knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You never took a poll or made a census?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. No; I have been looking after sewers and sick people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What do you do with the excreta or raw sewage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Do you mean our garbage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. No; the excreta from the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. From the water-closets or toilets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. We dump it into the river. It goes down through
the main sewer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Do you burn your garbage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You burn the least nocuous?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Well, we could not very well burn the sewage. We
burn the garbage; that is, it is emptied every day. We have a man
remove it every day. It is taken away and each cottage pays a certain
amount for its removal. We have nothing at Thousand Island
Park to breed disease but what we dispose of.</p>

<p>I have no apology to make for anything that we do that injures
our neighbors, because we really have not been looking out for that.
We would be very glad to if we were able. The last fire we had
damaged us about $250,000 to $300,000, so you will realize that we
have not much money to spare. We have the healthiest place that I
know of anywhere in the United States or Canada. Thousand
Island Park is really an international park. We have a tabernacle
in which we can seat about 3,000 people. We would be very glad to
cooperate with this commission, or with anybody else, for the benefit
of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River, but we are too poor to do it just now. I
did not come here to ask for anything, but to simply state to you
that we are doing everything we can for the protection of the health
of the people who visit us and of the people who go up and down
the river. I would like to ask whether or not this commission is
appointed from Washington?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. It is appointed by both Governments. The commission
was brought into existence by treaty between Great Britain
and the United States, and, among other things, they agreed in that
treaty that they would not permit the pollution of the boundary
waters to the injury of property or health on either side. Now,
the two Governments referred the question to this commission to
ascertain whether or not the terms of the treaty were being violated,
and if the waters were being polluted in contravention of the treaty.
The commission put bacteriologists at work, and they have demonstrated
beyond any question that the waters are being grossly polluted
in places in violation of the treaty. The Governments then
asked this commission to determine the remedy. That is what the
commission is at work upon at the present time, to devise a remedy
for this wholesale pollution that has been going on indiscriminately
all up and down the boundary waters. The fact that any one community
has been able to get pure water and avoid sickness does not
change the matter at all; if they are dumping their sewage into the
boundary water it is the duty of this commission to ascertain the
facts and report them to the Governments. If the Governments
accept the remedies that the commission finally submits to them
for adoption there will not, I apprehend, be any discrimination between
communities; they will all be treated alike.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. As I understand it this commission has nothing to
consider in regard to the purity or impurity of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Yes; the commission have to determine whether or
not the waters are being polluted in contravention of the treaty;
and, if so, what is the remedy. But the two countries have agreed
that the waters shall not be polluted to the injury of health or property
on the other side.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goodale</span>. Well, what are they going to do if it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Well, we are ascertaining the facts now. We are
trying to get at the actual conditions, and when we submit our report
to the Governments it is for them to devise the administrative part
of it. These two great Governments have joined in this movement,
and I do not think there is any question but that they will be able
to put a stop to what they regard as an unwarranted abuse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. Mr. Chairman, I came here on instructions from the
Dominion Marine Association and with no intention of saying anything
unless called upon. I have an opportunity of going home on
the 4 o’clock boat, which I would take if I had any assurance that
the question of the steamers is not coming any more definitely before
the commission than it has to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. The commission held a hearing in Detroit for the
special purpose of hearing the navigation interests, and they appeared
there. If you have anything to say we shall be glad to
hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I am not pressing for the opportunity, but I wish to
furnish the commission any information that they wish to obtain
with regard to the boats, and I did not like to leave without asking
the commission if they desired to ask any questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. So far as my recollection goes the representatives
of the navigation interests were very ready at the Detroit meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
to adopt any methods or remedies that proved to be reliable and
safe. So far as that feature of it is concerned we have regarded
the matter as closed. We are in perfect accord with them and
they with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I understood from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Phelps that the test is now
being made on the Lakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. It is, and in case there is any weakness I apprehend
it will be remedied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>. I hope you will call upon us at any time you need
information or assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Mr. Irving, the commission is now ready to hear the
representatives of the city of Ogdensburg.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. ANDREW IRVING,<br>CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
OF PUBLIC WORKS OF OGDENSBURG, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Mr. Chairman, the mayor of Ogdensburg was called
away, and will not be back again until after the first of the month.
The board of public works is represented, as is also the board of
water commissioners. I am president of the board of public works
and Mr. Darrow is president of the board of water commissioners.
We are prepared to give you any information that you may desire
with regard to the sewerage and water here. The city engineer is
also present, as well as the superintendent of the waterworks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Are you prepared to go on now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Yes; I would be glad to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. As president of the board of public works all the
public utilities come under your supervision, do they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. We have nothing to do with the water board. That
is a separate and distinct commission. Mr. Darrow represents that
commission. We have charge of the sewers, the building of the
sewers, and the building of the streets and public works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. What is the population of Ogdensburg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. About 18,000; that is, including the inmates of the
State hospitals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You simply do the work of constructing the sewers
and the manner and time of such construction is determined by the
State authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Yes, sir. I might more fully answer your question
by explaining our sewerage system. In 1872 <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> George E. Waring,
jr., was employed by the city of Ogdensburg to make a report upon
a system of sewers, which he did. He also presented plans and gave
a report as to the best method of sewering the city. Practically all
sewers that have been built since that time have been built on what
is called the Waring plan. The law provides that a sewer can not
be built unless plans are submitted to the two State commissions,
the State board of health and the State conservation commission.
They have to approve the plans before the sewers are built. After
those plans are adopted and approved by the two different commissions,
then our board constructs the sewers. That, of course, is
obligatory on the part of the city corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. That same condition applies all over the State?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. I believe it does. It certainly does so far as we
are concerned. It applies to all cities of our class, at any rate. We
are a city of the third class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You discharge your raw sewage into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. It all gets in there ultimately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Have you ever considered any plans for its purification
and sterilization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Practically we have not; no, sir. We have in a sort
of a desultory way spoken about it, because we can appreciate what
a necessary thing it would be, but we have never seriously considered
any plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have the State authorities ever urged any plan upon
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. No. Of course there is a general proposition always
floating about by the State authorities that the best way would be a
sewage-disposal plant of some kind, but it has never been brought
absolutely before us in concrete form. There has never been any
mandate issued that we should do that. As a matter of fact, within
the last year consent has been given to us to still empty the large
sewer into what is practically the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is the assessed valuation of the city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. I think it is about $6,000,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. What is the population?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. We consider it to be 18,000 people. That includes the
State institution down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. Have you any complaint to make against the Canadian
municipalities in the matter of pollution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. No; we are all in the same boat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Have you actually made any studies with regard
to a sewage purification plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. We never have. It has never been contemplated. It
is one of those questions that I presume we felt was a bridge that
would have to be crossed some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. How is your sewerage system situated with regard
to a purification plant? Have you one outlet or several?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. We have about 15 outlets altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. It would be necessary to have an interceptor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. I may say that while <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Waring suggested that at
some time some different system of disposal would be necessary, he
did not provide in the plan for any connection. You see we are
lying right along the front of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, and our outlets
reach from up at one end of the city down to the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Where is your waterworks intake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. The intake is well up above any local sewage. The
water commissioners will explain all that to you and give you some
valuable information regarding the contamination that they discovered
when they put in the intake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. You have no idea, have you, as to what it would
cost to install a purification plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. I have not the slightest idea. While Mr. Paterson
was telling you what could be done I was interested in reading a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
few remarks that were made by <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Waring in 1872, when he
suggested our sewerage system. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many of the objections that hold against the system of water sewerage in
most towns are inoperative in Ogdensburg. Not only can the whole city
(except a small district near the river) be completely drained by natural fall,
but the foul drainage will flow directly into a river that will carry it at once
away—a river so large that there is no danger of action ever being taken by
cities farther down the stream to prevent the contamination of the water.
Indeed the only considerable objection that I can think of against carrying
out a properly executed system of sewerage in Ogdensburg is the one item of
its wastefulness. Properly deodorized and applied to good agricultural land,
the night soil of a town of 10,000 inhabitants would be worth at least $50,000
annually. This shows that the item of wastefulness is worthy of the consideration
of all thoughtful persons, and there is no doubt that at some not
very distant day its force will be realized and the wasting of sewage will be
stopped.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is the name of this local river that enters
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. The Oswegatchie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. What is your indebtedness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. In 1914 it was $515,000, including the water board
debt. The water board debt at that time was $68,250. In computing
the bonded indebtedness of a town the water bonds are always excluded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Has there been any material change since then in
your financial situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. I presume that the issues would be about at a standoff.
There have been some few small local bonds issued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Does your water system pay its way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. These other gentlemen present can tell you about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. What is your tax rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. One dollar and ninety-eight cents this year. That
does not include our town tax; that is just the municipal tax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you have a State tax in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Do you tax real property, personal property, and
income?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Not income.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. That is exempted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. We tax personal property and real estate. Of course,
there is a national income tax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Do you have a county tax?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Yes; this $1.98 tax includes school and municipal
taxes. Then we also have what is called a county tax.</p>

<p>Is there anything else in the way of information that I can give
you about this matter? We have our sewer plans here, but I do not
suppose they would interest you. The fact is that what sewage we
have we empty into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. You are not an engineer, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Is your engineer present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Yes, sir. Would you like to have some information
from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Just a few questions bearing upon the sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Did you state what distance from the shore the
different outlets are?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Do you mean where they are situated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. No. We have the plans here. Part of them go into the
Oswegatchie River, which empties into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, but the
others are at different places along the shore; all under the permission
given to us by the two State boards and all practically following
this particular plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Magrath</span>. You do not contemplate installing any water-purification
plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Yes; we have a splendid one which the board of water
commissioners would be glad to tell you about. They are very proud
of it.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF ME. JOSEPH E. TATE,<br>CITY ENGINEER OF OGDENSBURG.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are the city engineer of Ogdensburg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have acted in that capacity how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. For about 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Does the city of Ogdensburg discharge its raw sewage
into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Most of it directly and some of it indirectly into the
Oswegatchie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You have no plant in which you first treat your
sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What kind of a water plant have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. A filtration plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. A sand filtration plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Have you suffered in Ogdensburg in recent years in
consequence of the pollution of the water that you drew from the
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>. Mr. Commissioner, will you allow me to suggest that
the water board is in a much better position to give you information
on those points than the city engineer, as those matters are under the
separate and distinct management of the board?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What cities are there on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence below
Ogdensburg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. I believe Montreal is the first large city below Ogdensburg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Are there any small cities or towns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Yes; there are several. There is Edwardsburg, or
Cardinal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How near is the nearest one to Ogdensburg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. About 8 miles. That is on the Canadian side of the
river. Then Waddington is 18 miles below. Morrisburg is nearly
directly opposite Waddington. Cornwall is farther down, about 40
miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Mr. Tate, is Ogdensburg a difficult country in which
to cut trenches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Not generally speaking; no. It is clay and sand. Of
course there are some streaks of hardpan here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is much rock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Well, there is on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. So it would be very expensive work to construct a
series of intercepting sewers to connect all the existing sewers, would
it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. If we put in filtration plants, we would have to have
two plants, one on each side of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. I am not speaking about your intake of water and
the filtration; I am speaking about connecting with the sewers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Of course if you treat the sewage, you would have to
have two separate plants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Yes; but you would have only one place where the
sewage debauched into the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. I think we would have to have two—one on the west
and one on the east side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Well, it would not be very expensive to make these
intercepting sewers, would it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. I rather think it would be quite expensive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. There is nothing in the character of the soil that
would make it expensive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. No; there is nothing in the character of the soil that
would do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. How far from the edge of the river do your sewers
discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Generally right at the face of the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Have you contemplated the making of sedimentation
beds or other means of purification of the sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You have never made any calculations in regard to
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Our system is a combined one. We take in the sewage
and all surface flows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Does the insane asylum down here connect with your
sewerage system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Is their sewage thrown into the river in a raw state?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> <span class="smcap">Phelps</span>. Could you intercept all the sewage without pumping,
Mr. Tate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate</span>. I hardly think we could. I think very likely we would
have to pump.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF MR. GEORGE F. DARROW,<br>PRESIDENT OF THE
WATER BOARD OF OGDENSBURG.<br>
</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Mr. Darrow, you are the president of the water
commissioners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What have you to say in regard to the disposal of
your sewage in the city of Ogdensburg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Well, we have never suffered from any pollution of
the water supply, because we have filtered all of our water that has
been taken from the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence. Our water supply up to four
or five years ago was the local river, the Oswegatchie, but we suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
from typhoid there, and we changed over into the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
and put in a slow sand filtration plant. We have been almost completely
free from any typhoid or any other water-borne disease since
then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you chlorinate your water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. No; we never have, except at one time, when we had
a little break in our intake pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You discharge all your sewage directly into the
river, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Yes, sir. The intake pipe is above the city and there
is nothing that would cause contamination nearer than the village of
Morristown, which is 12 miles away on this side of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How is it with respect to the towns below you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. The State hospital formerly got their water supply
from the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, and they suffered so severely from typhoid,
owing to the pollution by the city, that they changed their water
supply to the city supply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How far is the hospital from the city of Ogdensburg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. It is a part of the city of Ogdensburg, but it is probably
2 or 3 miles below the center of the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. How many people are there in that institution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Two thousand, or a little over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is the width of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River here
in this vicinity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. It is about a mile and a quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. Do you have daily examinations of the water in order
to ascertain its purity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Yes; our superintendent can give you all details as
to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. It is practically free from bacteria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Yes; practically so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What supervision is exercised by the State board of
health over your water supply and the health conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. It was put in entirely under their supervision and
protection, and the health officer takes samples of water from the
taps throughout the city at any place he desires, and those samples
are submitted to test at Albany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Does the State board of health have any voice in the
management or supervision of your plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. I can not say as to that. There has never been any
interference on their part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Do you make reports to the State board of health
with respect to the purification of your water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. No, sir. I understand, however, that if the plant
goes wrong they have the power to come in and see that matters are
corrected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. In other words, they have the power to lock the
stable after the horse is stolen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You supply the material for the test and the State
makes the test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. We have our own laboratory that makes its own
tests, and then the State board of health supplements those tests from
time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. They take their own samples?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there any State law in New York with respect to
the discharge of raw sewage into rivers or running streams that you
know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Not that I am aware of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. So every city or village or town is free to utilize the
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River, or any other river on which it may be located,
as an open sewer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. That seems to be the case; at least, they practice it.
I know that where shallow streams have been used and it has been
a palpable nuisance that they have applied for injunctions and restraining
orders on account of its being a nuisance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. What is your opinion with respect to the wisdom
of utilizing these running streams as open sewers? Do you think
cities of some considerable size should be prohibited from discharging
raw sewage into streams where cities below are dependent upon
the same stream for their water for domestic and sanitary uses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. I think they should be prohibited from doing so.
I think that all pollution of all streams should be prohibited. I
think that it is not only a menace to the public health, but it is a
great economic loss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. That is the judgment of all the sanitary experts and
engineers that we have had before us throughout this entire investigation,
and I am very glad to know that you corroborate their views.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell</span>. You are opposed to depositing raw sewage into a
stream entirely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. I certainly am. Of course, I think it is an evil that
has got to be overcome slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Yes; but ultimately it will have to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Ultimately it will have to come; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mignault</span>. Then, your opinion is that cities should be forced
to treat their sewage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. Just as speedily as it can be accomplished. I think
it is on a par with garbage collection; that it should be done, and
that eventually cities will find that it is a source of income instead of
a source of expense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. Is there any other gentleman from Ogdensburg who
wishes to be heard now, or who has anything to offer on the subject?</p>

<p>(There was no response.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>. If not, we will proceed to hear the representatives
of the next town who appear before us.</p>

<p>(There was no response.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Is there anyone else from any other city or town
on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence in this vicinity who desires to be heard on this
subject?</p>

<p>(There was no response.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. Dr. McCullough, have you or Mr. Dallyn anything
to offer with respect to this <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence district?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. For my own part, I do not think so. I think
all we have to say about it is set out in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. You are the head of the health service in the Province
of Ontario?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McCullough</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. I want these gentlemen present to know that you
are the head of the health service in the Province of Ontario, and
that Mr. Dallyn is the sanitary engineer of the Province.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Darrow</span>. I think something ought to be done with the State
of New York, because all of these plans for sewerage in the boundary
waters are approved by the State of New York. The institutions
owned by the State of New York are running their sewage into the
boundary waters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tawney</span>. The State boards of health, I think all of them,
have been very cordially in sympathy with the investigation into
this matter which the commission has been conducting for the last
three years, and I do not apprehend that any recommendations that
the commission may finally make to the two Governments, with respect
to it, will be opposed by the State, judging from the expressions
we have had from them. If there is nothing further, the hearing
will be considered closed, and the commission will go into executive
session for the purpose of considering some other matters that
we intend to take up at this time.</p>

<p>(The commission then went into executive session and the hearing
adjourned.)</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were
moved to follow the table in which the related anchor occurs.</p>

<p>Words may have inconsistent hyphenation in the text. Misspelled words were corrected,
as were obvious printing errors, such as words missing a letter or
letters in reversed order, and incorrect punctuation at the
ends of sentences.</p>

<p>There are several references in the proceedings to “B. coli,” that could have been
mistyped by the recording secretary for “E. coli.”</p>

<p>The following were changed:</p>

<ul>
<li>added missing <a href="#chg1">“of”</a> … water out of it …</li>
<li>changed <a href="#chg2">“deduce”</a> to “produce” … produce a lot of chemicals … </li>
</ul>
